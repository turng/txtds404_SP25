            <p>This edition was created as part of TXTDS four oh four at the University of
               Washington over the course of Spring Quarter 2025. Our first goal with this digital
               edition is to reproduce the copytext as close to the original as possible, including
               text itself as well as form, format, and illustrations, using the tools of digital
               editing such as XML, TEI, HTML, and CSS. Our second goal is to include interesting
               contextual information to the story to enrich and contextualize a reader's experience
               by connecting readers with Doyle’s history with The Strand and also to the geographic
               elements in the story and its mediation. We are also interested in how historic
               audiences received and reacted to the story. Our edition, including our HTML and CSS
               formatting of the TEI encoding, was published online using the Vergil web publishing
               system.</p>

         <sourceDesc>
            <p>Our source text is “The Hound of the Baskervilles” by Arthur Conan Doyle as it was
               first published in Strand Magazine, in August 1901. The Magazine was published in
               London, England. The story text consists of pages 122 through 132 (11 total) of the
               August issue. It also contains seven illustrations with captions for the actions they
               depict, most of which are nestled within the text. The first page of text also
               doubles as the title page for that month’s issue. Our specific copytext is a bound
               volume of Strand Magazine issues which is held in Special Collections at University
               of Washington Libraries under the call number 051 SM v.22. This is the 22nd volume of
               collected magazine issues and was published by the Strand in December of 1901.</p>

            <p>Sherlock Holmes is such a widely known character it’s difficult to find a way to
               introduce him. He retains global popularity even after almost one hundred years since
               his last published adventure by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. There are fifty-six short
               stories and four novels that comprise the sixty canon Sherlock stories, with The
               Hound of the Baskervilles being the third serialized novel. This text is significant
               not only because of its remarkable literary merit as a standout entry in the Sherlock
               Holmes canon, but also because it was the first text published after The Final
               Problem, where Sherlock had died. Sherlock’s death had sparked grief and outrage,
               including people unsubscribing from The Strand magazine. His return was welcomed and
               widely read and remains a must-read for people seeking the best of Sir Arthur Conan
               Doyle’s work.</p>
            <p>Our edition aims to produce a digital version of the original text and formatting of
               “The Hound of Baskervilles” that will connect modern readers to the original
               publication. Modern readers most often access the Sherlock Holmes stories through
               adaptations and remediations that, for example, collect the different serialized
               chapters into one unit. With our edition, readers can think about how the original
               way the story was published in the Strand magazine might have affected readers’
               experience, the significance of place to the story and to its publication, and
               experience a digital recreation of the original formatting and feel of the story.</p>
            <p>Our editorial decisions coalesce around the approach of attempting to create as close
               of a type facsimile as possible, in line with the aim of our editorial work. In this
               spirit we will maintain spelling and punctuation as they appear in the text. We will
               also maintain the layout of the text, including columns, pages, where images are
               placed, and where words are split between lines. One area where we might have to
               diverge from a type facsimile’s recreation of our source is with the column
               dimensions, depending on whether we can measure them in our source. This approach
               aligns with our project goals by providing our readers with insight into the
               serialized magazine publication format we are closely recreating. </p>

                  with eugenics, phrenology involves studying the shape and form of human skulls as

                  person. This practice was done in service of colonialism and white supremacy. It
                  was used to ascribe biological and scientific reality to racial hierarchies.
                  Racist ideas about the behavior and psychology of African, Indigenous, and other
