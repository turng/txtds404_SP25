            <p>This edition was created as part of TXTDS 404 at the University of Washington over
               the course of Spring Quarter 2025. Our first goal with this digital edition is to
               reproduce the copytext as close to the original as possible, including text itself as
               well as form, format, and illustrations, using the tools of digital editing such as
               XML, TEI, HTML, and CSS. Our second goal is to include interesting contextual
               information to the story to enrich and contextualize a reader's experience by
               connecting readers with Doyle’s history with The Strand and also to the geographic
               elements in the story and its mediation. We are also interested in how historic
               audiences received and reacted to the story. Our edition, including our HTML and CSS
               formatting of the TEI encoding, was published online using the Vergil web publishing
               system.</p>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>Our aim with editiorial decisions is to avoid altering the text and its presentation
               minimally. Original spelling, format, and punctuation is recreated wherever we can.
               We will normalize certain punctuation that resembles em dashes and dashes but are
               neither.</p>

            <p>MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, <lb break="yes"/>who was usually very late in <lb break="yes"
               />the mornings, save upon those <lb break="yes"/>not infrequent occasions when <lb
                  break="yes"/>he was up all night, was seated <lb break="yes"/>at the breakfast
               table. I stood <lb break="yes"/>upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick <lb
                  break="yes"/>which our visitor had left behind him the night <lb break="yes"
               />before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, <lb break="yes"/>bulbous-headed, of the
               sort which is known <lb break="yes"/>as a "Penang lawyer." Just under the head <lb
                  break="yes"/>was a broad silver band, nearly an inch <lb break="yes"/>across. "To
               James Mortimer, M. R. C. S., <lb break="yes"/>from his friends of the C. C. H.," was
               engraved <lb break="yes"/>upon it, with the date "1884." It was just <lb break="yes"
               />such a stick as the old-fashioned family <lb break="yes"/>practitioner used to
               carry—dignified, solid, <lb break="yes"/>and reassuring.</p>
            <p><s>"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?"</s></p>
            <p>Holmes was sitting with his back to me, <lb break="yes"/>and I had given him no sign
               of my occupa-<lb break="no"/>tion.</p>
            <p><s>"How did you know what I was doing? <lb break="yes"/>I believe you have eyes in
                  the back of your <lb break="yes"/>head."</s></p>
            <p><s>"I have, at least, a well-polished silver-<lb break="yes"/>plated coffee-pot in
                  front of me,"</s> said he. <lb break="yes"/><s>"But, tell me, Watson, what do you
                  make of <lb break="yes"/>our visitor's stick? Since we have been so <lb
                     break="yes"/>unfortunate as to miss him and have no <lb break="yes"/>notion of
                  his errand, this accidental souvenir <lb break="yes"/>becomes of importance. Let
                  me hear you <lb break="yes"/>reconstruct the man by an examination of it."</s></p>
            <p><s>"I think," said I, following as far as I could <lb break="yes"/>the methods of my
                  companion, "that Dr. <lb break="yes"/>Mortimer is a successful elderly medical
                  man, <fw type="-----">
                     <!--what should we call this??????????-->* This story owes its inception to my
                     friend, Mr. Fletcher <lb break="yes"/>Robinson, who has helped me both in the
                     general plot and in <lb break="yes"/>the local details.—A. C. D.</fw>
                  <cb/><lb break="yes"/>well-esteemed, since those who know him <lb break="yes"
                  />give him this mark of their appreciation."</s></p>
            <p><s>"Good!"</s> said Holmes. <s>"Excellent!"</s></p>
            <p><s>"I think also that the probability is in <lb break="yes"/>favour of his being a
                  country practitioner <lb break="yes"/>who does a great deal of his visiting on
                  foot."</s></p>
            <p><s>"Why so?"</s></p>
            <p><s>"Because this stick, though originally a <lb break="yes"/>very handsome one, has
                  been so knocked <lb break="yes"/>about that I can hardly imagine a town <lb
                     break="yes"/>practitioner carrying it. The thick iron <lb break="yes"/>ferrule
                  is worn down, so it is evident that he <lb break="yes"/>has done a great amount of
                  walking with it."</s></p>
            <p><s>"Perfectly sound !"</s> said Holmes.</p>
            <p><s>"And then again, there is the 'friends of<lb break="yes"/> the C.C.H.' I should
                  guess that to be the <lb break="yes"/>Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose <lb
                     break="yes"/>members he has possibly given some surgical <lb break="yes"
                  />assistance, and which has made him a small <lb break="yes"/>presentation in
                  return."</s></p>
            <p><s>"Really, Watson, you excel yourself,"</s> said <lb break="yes"/>Holmes, pushing
               back his chair and lighting <lb break="yes"/>a cigarette. <s>"I am bound to say that
                  in all <lb break="yes"/>the accounts which you have been so good <lb break="yes"
                  />as to give of my own small achievements you <lb break="no"/>have habitually
                  underrated your own abilities. <lb break="yes"/>It may be that you are not
                  yourself luminous, <lb break="yes"/>but you are a conductor of light. Some <lb
                     break="yes"/>people without possessing genius have a <lb break="yes"
                  />remarkable power of stimulating it. I con-<lb break="no"/>fess, my dear fellow,
                  that I am very much in <lb break="yes"/>your debt."</s></p>
            <p>He had never said as much before, and I <lb break="yes"/>must admit that his words
               gave me keen <lb break="yes"/>pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his <lb
                  break="yes"/>indifference to my admiration and to the <lb break="yes"/>attempts
               which I had made to give publicity <lb break="yes"/>to his methods. I was proud too
               to think <lb break="yes"/>that I had so far mastered his system as to <lb break="yes"
               />apply it in a way which earned his approval. <lb break="yes"/>He now took the stick
               from my hands<fw type="--------------------">Vol. xxii.-16.</fw>
               <!-- what type would this fw be??????-->
               <pb n="124"/><fw type="RunnningHead" rend="caps"> 124 The Strand
               Magazine.</fw><cb/>and examined it for a few minutes with his <lb break="yes"/>naked
               eyes. Then with an expression of <lb break="yes"/>interest he laid down his cigarette
               and, carry-<lb break="no"/>ing the cane to the window, he looked over <lb break="yes"
               />it again with a convex lens.</p>
            <p>"Interesting, though elementary," said he, <lb break="yes"/>as he returned to his
               favourite corner of the <lb break="yes"/>settee. "There are certainly one or two <lb
                  break="yes"/>indications upon the stick. <lb break="yes"/>It gives us the basis
               for <lb break="yes"/>several deductions."</p>
            <p>"Has anything escaped <lb break="yes"/>me?" I asked, with some <lb break="yes"
               />self-importance. "I trust <lb break="yes"/>that there is nothing of <lb break="yes"
               />consequence which I have <lb break="yes"/>overlooked?"</p>
            <p>"I am afraid, my dear <lb break="yes"/>Watson, that most of your <lb break="yes"
               />conclusions were erro-<lb break="no"/>neous. When I said that <lb break="yes"/>you
               stimulated me I meant, <lb break="yes"/>to be frank, that in noting <lb break="yes"
               />your fallacies I was occa-<lb break="no"/>sionally guided towards the <lb
                  break="yes"/>truth. Not that you are <lb break="yes"/>entirely wrong in this
                  in-<lb break="no"/>stance. The man is cer-<lb break="no"/>tainly a country
                  practi-<lb break="yes"/>tioner. And he walks a <lb break="yes"/>good deal."</p>
            <p>"Then I was right."</p>
            <p>"To that extent."</p>
            <p>"But that was all."</p>
            <p>"No, no, my dear Wat-<lb break="no"/>son, not all—by no means <lb break="yes"/>all. I
               would suggest, for <lb break="yes"/>example, that a presenta-<lb break="no"/>tion to
               a doctor is more <lb break="yes"/>likely to come from an <lb break="yes"/>hospital
               than from a <lb break="yes"/>hunt, and that when <lb break="yes"/>the initials 'C.C.'
               are <lb break="yes"/>placed before that hospital <lb break="yes"/>the words 'Charing
                  <lb break="yes"/>Cross' very naturally suggest themselves."</p>
            <p>"You may be right."</p>
            <p>"The probability lies in that direction. <lb break="yes"/>And if we take this as a
               working hypothesis <lb break="yes"/>we have a fresh basis from which to start our <lb
                  break="yes"/>construction of this unknown visitor."</p>
            <p>"Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does <lb break="yes"/>stand for 'Charing Cross
               Hospital,' what <lb break="yes"/>further inferences may we draw?"</p>
            <p>"Do none suggest themselves? You <lb break="yes"/>know my methods. Apply them!"</p>
            <p>"I can only think of the obvious conclu-<lb break="no"/>sion that the man has
               practiced in town <lb break="yes"/>before going to the country."</p>

            <cb/>
            <p>"I think that we might venture a little <lb break="yes"/>farther than this. Look at
               it in this <lb break="yes"/>light. On what occasion would it be <lb break="yes"/>most
               probable that such a presentation <lb break="yes"/>would be made? When would his
               friends <lb break="yes"/>unite to give him a pledge of their good will? <lb
                  break="yes"/>Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer <lb break="yes"/>withdrew
               from the service of the hospital in <lb break="yes"/>order to start in practice <lb
                  break="yes"/>for himself. We know <lb break="yes"/>there has been a presenta-<lb
                  break="no"/>tion. We believe there has <lb break="yes"/>been a change from a town
                  <lb break="yes"/>hospital to a country prac-<lb break="no"/>tice. Is it, then,
               stretching <lb break="yes"/>our inference too far to say <lb break="yes"/>that the
               presentation was <lb break="yes"/>on the occasion of the <lb break="yes"
               />change?"</p>
            <p>"It certainly seems <lb break="yes"/>probable."</p>
            <p>"Now, you will observe <lb break="yes"/>that he could not have been <lb break="yes"
               />on the <emph rend="italics">staff</emph> of the hospital, <lb break="yes"/>since
               only a man well-<lb break="maybe"/>established in a London <lb break="yes"/>practice
               could hold such a <lb break="yes"/>position, and such a one <lb break="yes"/>would
               not drift into the <lb break="yes"/>country. What was he then? <lb break="yes"/>If he
               was in the hos-<lb break="no"/>pital and yet not on the <lb break="yes"/>staff he
               could only have <lb break="yes"/>been a house-surgeon or a <lb break="yes"
               />house-physician — little <lb break="yes"/>more than a senior student. <lb
                  break="yes"/>And he left five years ago<lb break="yes"/>—the date is on the stick.
                  <lb break="yes"/>So on your grave, middle-aged <lb break="yes"/>family
               practitioner vanishes <lb break="yes"/>into thin air, <lb break="yes"/>my dear
                  Wat-<lb break="no"/>son, and there emerges a <lb break="yes"/>young fellow under
               thirty, <lb break="yes"/>amiable, unambitious, <lb break="yes"/>absent-minded, and
               the <lb break="yes"/>possessor of a favourite dog, which I should <lb break="yes"
               />describe roughly as being larger than a terrier <lb break="yes"/>and smaller than a
               mastiff."</p>
            <p>I laughed incredulously as Sherlock <lb break="yes"/>Holmes leaned back in his settee
               and blew <lb break="yes"/>little wavering rings of smoke up to the <lb break="yes"
               />ceiling.</p>
            <p>"As to the latter part, I have no means <lb break="yes"/>of checking you," said I,
               "but at least <lb break="yes"/>it is not difficult to find out a few par-<lb
                  break="no"/>ticulars about the man's age and profes-<lb break="no"/>sional
               career." From my small medical <lb break="yes"/>shelf I took down the Medical
               Directory and <lb break="yes"/>turned up the name. There were several <pb n="125"
                  /><fw type="RunningHead" rend="caps">The Hound of the Baskervilles 125</fw>
               Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.</p>

            <p>"Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon. House surgeon, from 1882
               to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital. Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative
               Pathology, with essay entitled 'Is Disease a Reversion?' Corresponding member of the
               Swedish Pathological Society. Author of 'Some Freaks of Atavism' (Lancet, 1882). 'Do
               We Progress?' (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes
               of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow."</p>
            <p>"No mention of that local hunt, Watson," said Holmes, with a mischievous smile, "but
               a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think that I am fairly justified
               in my infer-ences. As to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,
               unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in
               this world who receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London
               career for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not
               his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room."</p>
            <p>"And the dog?"</p>
            <p>"Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a heavy stick
               the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his teeth are very
               plainly visible. The dog's jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too
               broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It may have
               been—yes, by Jove, it is a curly-haired spaniel."</p>
            <p>He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess of the
               window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I glanced up in
               surprise.</p>
            <p>"My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?"</p>
            <p>"For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door-step, and
               there is the ring 
               
               <cb/>of its owner. Don't move, I beg you, Watson. He is a professional
               brother of yours, and your presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic
               moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into
               your life, and you know not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer,
