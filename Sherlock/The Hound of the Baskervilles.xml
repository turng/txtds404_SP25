            <p>This edition was created as part of TXTDS 404 at the University of Washington over
               the course of Spring Quarter 2025. Our first goal with this digital edition is to
               reproduce the copytext as close to the original as possible, including text itself as
               well as form, format, and illustrations, using the tools of digital editing such as
               XML, TEI, HTML, and CSS. Our second goal is to include interesting contextual
               information to the story to enrich and contextualize a reader's experience by
               connecting readers with Doyle’s history with The Strand and also to the geographic
               elements in the story and its mediation. We are also interested in how historic
               audiences received and reacted to the story. Our edition, including our HTML and CSS
               formatting of the TEI encoding, was published online using the Vergil web publishing
               system.</p>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>Our aim with editiorial decisions is to avoid altering the text and its presentation
               minimally. Original spelling, format, and punctuation is recreated wherever we can.
               We will normalize certain punctuation that resembles em dashes and dashes but are
               neither.</p>

            <p>MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, <lb break="yes"/>who was usually very late in <lb break="yes"/>the
               mornings, save upon those <lb break="yes"/>not infrequent occasions when <lb
                  break="yes"/>he was up all night, was seated <lb break="yes"/>at the breakfast
               table. I stood <lb break="yes"/>upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick <lb
                  break="yes"/>which our visitor had left behind him the night <lb break="yes"
                  />before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, <lb break="yes"/>bulbous-headed, of the
               sort which is known <lb break="yes"/>as a "Penang lawyer." Just under the head <lb
                  break="yes"/>was a broad silver band, nearly an inch <lb break="yes"/>across. "To
               James Mortimer, M. R. C. S., <lb break="yes"/>from his friends of the C. C. H.," was
               engraved <lb break="yes"/>upon it, with the date "1884." It was just <lb break="yes"
               />such a stick as the old-fashioned family <lb break="yes"/>practitioner used to
               carry—dignified, solid, <lb break="yes"/>and reassuring.</p>
            <p><s>"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?"</s></p>
            <p>Holmes was sitting with his back to me, <lb break="yes"/>and I had given him no sign
               of my occupa-<lb break="no"/>tion.</p>
            <p><s>"How did you know what I was doing? <lb break="yes"/>I believe you have eyes in the
                  back of your <lb break="yes"/>head."</s></p>
            <p><s>"I have, at least, a well-polished silver-<lb break="yes"/>plated coffee-pot in
                  front of me,"</s> said he. <lb break="yes"/><s>"But, tell me, Watson, what do you
                     make of <lb break="yes"/>our visitor's stick? Since we have been so <lb break="yes"
                     />unfortunate as to miss him and have no <lb break="yes"/>notion of his errand,
                     this accidental souvenir <lb break="yes"/>becomes of importance. Let me hear you
                     <lb break="yes"/>reconstruct the man by an examination of it."</s></p>
            <p><s>"I think," said I, following as far as I could <lb break="yes"/>the methods of my
                  companion, "that Dr. <lb break="yes"/>Mortimer is a successful elderly medical man,

                     <!--what should we call this??????????-->* This story owes its inception to my
                        friend, Mr. Fletcher <lb break="yes"/>Robinson, who has helped me both in the
                        general plot and in <lb break="yes"/>the local details.—A. C. D.</fw>
                  <cb/><lb break="yes"/>well-esteemed, since those who know him <lb break="yes"/>give
                  him this mark of their appreciation."</s></p>
            <p><s>"Good!"</s> said Holmes. <s>"Excellent!"</s></p>
            <p><s>"I think also that the probability is in <lb break="yes"/>favour of his being a
                  country practitioner <lb break="yes"/>who does a great deal of his visiting on
                  foot."</s></p>
            <p><s>"Why so?"</s></p>
            <p><s>"Because this stick, though originally a <lb break="yes"/>very handsome one, has
                  been so knocked <lb break="yes"/>about that I can hardly imagine a town <lb
                     break="yes"/>practitioner carrying it. The thick iron <lb break="yes"/>ferrule is
                  worn down, so it is evident that he <lb break="yes"/>has done a great amount of
                  walking with it."</s></p>
            <p><s>"Perfectly sound !"</s> said Holmes.</p>
            <p><s>"And then again, there is the 'friends of<lb break="yes"/> the C.C.H.' I should
                  guess that to be the <lb break="yes"/>Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose <lb
                     break="yes"/>members he has possibly given some surgical <lb break="yes"
                     />assistance, and which has made him a small <lb break="yes"/>presentation in
                  return."</s></p>
            <p><s>"Really, Watson, you excel yourself,"</s> said <lb break="yes"/>Holmes, pushing
               back his chair and lighting <lb break="yes"/>a cigarette. <s>"I am bound to say that
                  in all <lb break="yes"/>the accounts which you have been so good <lb break="yes"/>as
                  to give of my own small achievements you <lb break="no"/>have habitually
                  underrated your own abilities. <lb break="yes"/>It may be that you are not yourself
                  luminous, <lb break="yes"/>but you are a conductor of light. Some <lb break="yes"
                  />people without possessing genius have a <lb break="yes"/>remarkable power of
                  stimulating it. I con-<lb break="no"/>fess, my dear fellow, that I am very much
                  in <lb break="yes"/>your debt."</s></p>
            <p>He had never said as much before, and I <lb break="yes"/>must admit that his words
               gave me keen <lb break="yes"/>pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his <lb
                  break="yes"/>indifference to my admiration and to the <lb break="yes"/>attempts
               which I had made to give publicity <lb break="yes"/>to his methods. I was proud too to
               think <lb break="yes"/>that I had so far mastered his system as to <lb break="yes"
               />apply it in a way which earned his approval. <lb break="yes"/>He now took the stick
               from my hands<fw type="--------------------">Vol. xxii.-16.</fw> <!-- what type would this fw be??????-->

               an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette and, carry-ing the cane to the
               window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.</p>
            <p>"Interesting, though elementary," said he, as he returned to his favourite corner of
               the settee. "There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. It gives us
               the basis for several deductions."</p>
            <p>"Has anything escaped me?" I asked, with some self-importance. "I trust that there is
               nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?"</p>
            <p>"I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erro-neous. When I
               said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was
               occa-sionally guided towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this
               in-stance. The man is cer-tainly a country practi-tioner. And he walks a good
               deal."</p>
            <p>"Then I was right."</p>
            <p>"To that extent."</p>
            <p>"But that was all."</p>
            <p>"No, no, my dear Wat-son, not all—by no means all. I would suggest, for example, that
               a presenta-tion to a doctor is more likely to come from an hospital than from a hunt,
               and that when the initials 'C.C.' are placed before that hospital the words 'Charing
               Cross' very naturally suggest themselves."</p>
            <p>"You may be right."</p>
            <p>"The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working hypothesis
               we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown
               visitor."</p>
            <p>"Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for 'Charing Cross Hospital,' what
               further inferences may we draw?"</p>
            <p>"Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!"</p>
            <p>"I can only think of the obvious conclu-sion that the man has practiced in town
               before going to the country."</p>
            <p>"I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in this light.
               On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made?
               When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at
               the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to
               start in practice for himself. We know there has been a presenta-tion. We believe
               there has been a change from a town hospital to a country prac-tice. Is it, then,
               stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of
               the change?"</p>
            <p>"It certainly seems probable."</p>
            <p>"Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital,
               since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position,
               and such a one would not drift into the country. What was he then? If he was in the
               hos-pital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a
               house-physician—little more than a senior student. And he left five years ago—the
               date is on the stick. So on your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into
               thin air, my dear Wat-son, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable,
               unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should
               describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff."</p>
            <p>I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little
               wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.</p>
            <p>"As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you," said I, "but at least it is
               not difficult to find out a few par-ticulars about the man's age and profes-sional
               career." From my small medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up
               the name. There were several
