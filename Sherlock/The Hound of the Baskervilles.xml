         ANOTHER ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.
         BY CONAN DOYLE. 
         <div type="chapter" n="1"> CHAPTER I.
               <ab>MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.</ab>
            <p>MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not
               infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table. I
               stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind
               him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort
               which is known as a "Penang lawyer." Just under the head was a broad silver band,
               nearly an inch across. "To James Mortimer, M. R. C. S., from his friends of the C. C.
               H.," was engraved upon it, with the date "1884." It was just such a stick as the
               old-fashioned family practitioner used to carryâ€”dignified, solid, and reassuring.</p>
            <p><s>"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?"</s></p>
            <p>Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my
               occupa-tion.</p>
            <p><s>"How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of your
               head."</s></p>
            <p><s>"I have, at least, a well-polished silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me,"</s> said
               he.</p>
            <p><s>"But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's stick? Since we have been so
               unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir
               becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of
               it."</s></p> 
            <p><s>"I think," said I, following as far as I could the methods of my companion,
            "that Dr. Mortimer is a successful elderly medical man, </s>*</p>
