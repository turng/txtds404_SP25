            <p><persName ref="#Mortimer">Dr. Mortimer</persName> blinked through his glasses<lb

                  hopes of a consulting<lb break="yes"/>practice. It was necessary to make a home<lb

                        have<lb break="yes"/>any objection to my running my finger along<lb

                     until the original is available, would be<lb break="yes"/>an ornament to any
                     anthropological museum.<lb break="yes"/>It is not my intention to be fulsome,

            <p><persName ref="#Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName> waved our strange visitor<lb

                  of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in<lb break="yes"/>mine,"</said> said he.
                  <said>"I observe from your fore-finger that you make your own cigarettes.<lb

            <p>The man drew out paper and tobacco and<lb break="yes"/>twirled the one up into the
               other with surpis-<lb break="no"/>ing dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers<lb

            <p><persName ref="#Holmes">Holmes</persName> was silent, but his little darting<lb
                  break="yes"/>glances showed me the interest which he<lb break="yes"/>took in our
               curious companion.</p>
            <cb/>
            <p><said>"I presume, sir,"</said> said he at last, <said>"that it<lb break="yes"/>was not
                  merely for the purpose of examining<lb break="yes"/>my skull that you have done me
                  the honour<lb break="yes"/>to call here last night and again to-day?"</said></p>
            <p><said>"No, sir, no; though I am happy to have<lb break="yes"/>had the opportunity of
                  doing that as well. I<lb break="yes"/>came to you, <persName ref="#Holmes">Mr.
                     Holmes</persName>, because I recog-<lb break="no"/>nise that I am myself an

            <p><said>"Then had you not better consult him?"</said></p>
            <p><said>"I said, sir, to the precisely scientific<lb break="yes"/>mind. But as a

            <p><said>"Just a little," said <persName ref="#Holmes">Holmes</persName>. "I think,<lb

                  wisely if without<lb break="yes"/>more ado you would kindly tell me plainly<lb
                     break="yes"/>what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my

               <p><said>"How can you say that, sir?"</said></p>
               <p><said>"You have presented an inch or two of it<lb break="yes"/>to my examination
                     all the time that you have<lb break="yes"/>been talking. It would be a poor
