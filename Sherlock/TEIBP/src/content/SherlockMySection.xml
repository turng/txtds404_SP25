                     break="yes"/>the words used by <persName ref="#HBaskerville">Hugo
                     Baskerville</persName>, when<lb break="yes"/>he was in wine, were such as might
                  blast the<lb break="yes"/>man who said them. At last in the stress of<lb
                     break="yes"/>her fear she did that which might have<lb break="yes"/>daunted the
                  bravest or most active man, for<lb break="yes"/>by the aid of the growth of ivy
                  which covered<lb break="yes"/>(and still covers) the south wall she came down from
                  under the eaves, and so home-<lb break="no"/>ward across the moor, there being
                     three<lb break="yes"/>leagues betwixt <placeName ref="#BaskervilleHall">the
                     Hall</placeName> and her father's farm.</said></p>
            <p><said>"It chanced that some little time later<lb break="yes"/><persName
                     ref="#HBaskerville">Hugo</persName> left his guests to carry food and drink<lb
                     break="yes"/>—with other worse things, perchance—to <persName ref="#theMaiden"
                        >his<lb break="yes"/>captive</persName>, and so found the cage empty and
                     <persName ref="#theMaiden">the<lb break="yes"/>bird</persName> escaped. Then,
                  as it would seem, he<lb break="yes"/>became as one that hath a devil, for,
                     rushing<lb break="yes"/>down the stairs into the dining-hall, he<lb break="yes"
                  />sprang upon the great table, flagons and<lb break="yes"/>trenchers flying before
                  him, and he cried<lb break="yes"/>aloud before all the company that he would<lb
                     break="yes"/>that very night render his body and soul to<lb break="yes"/>the
                     <ref>Powers of Evil</ref> if he might but overtake<lb break="yes"/><persName
                     ref="theMaiden">the wench</persName>. And while the revelers stood<lb
                     break="yes"/>aghast at the fury of the man, one more<lb break="yes"/>wicked or,
                  it may be, more drunken than<lb break="yes"/>the rest, cried out that they should
                  put the<lb break="yes"/>hounds upon her. Whereat <persName ref="#HBaskerville"
                     >Hugo</persName> ran from<lb break="yes"/>the house, crying to his grooms that
                     they<lb break="yes"/>should saddle his mare and unkennel the<lb break="yes"
                  />pack, and giving the hounds a kerchief of<cb/>the maid's, he swung them to the
                  line, and so<lb break="yes"/>off full cry in the moonlight over <placeName
                     ref="#theMoor">the moor</placeName>.</said></p>
            <p><said>"Now, for some space the revelers stood<lb break="yes"/>agape, unable to
                  understand all that<lb break="yes"/>had been done in such haste. But anon their
                     =<lb break="yes"/>bemused wits awoke to the nature of the<lb break="yes"/>deed
                  which was like to be done upon <placeName ref="#theMoor">the<lb break="yes"
                     />moorlands</placeName>. Everything was now in an up-<lb break="no"/>roar, some
                  calling for their pistols, some for<lb break="yes"/>their horses, and some for
                  another flask of<lb break="yes"/>wine. But at length some sense came back<lb
                     break="yes"/>to their crazed minds, and the whole of them,<lb break="yes"
                  />thirteen in number, took horse and started in<lb break="yes"/>pursuit. The moon
                  shone clear above them,<lb break="yes"/>and they rode swiftly abreast, taking
                     that<lb break="yes"/>course which <persName ref="#theMaiden">the
                     maid</persName> must needs have taken<lb break="yes"/>if she were to reach her
                  own home.</said></p>
            <p><said>"They had gone a mile or two when they<lb break="yes"/>passed one of the night
                  shepherds upon <placeName ref="#theMoor">the<lb break="yes"
                  />moorlands</placeName>, and they cried to him to know if<lb break="yes"/>he had
                  seen the hunt. And the man, as the<lb break="yes"/>story goes, was so crazed with
                  fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that<lb break="yes"/>he had
                  indeed seen <persName ref="#theMaiden">the unhappy maiden</persName>,<lb
                     break="yes"/>with the hounds upon her track. 'But I<lb break="yes"/>have seen
                  more than that,'<!-- what do we do about quotes in said? --> said he, 'for<lb
                     break="yes"/><persName>Hugo Baskerville</persName> passed me upon his black<lb
                     break="yes"/>mare, and there ran mute behind him such a<lb break="yes"/>hound
                  of hell as God forbid should ever be<lb break="yes"/>at my heels.' So the drunken
                     squires<lb break="yes"/>cursed the shepherd and rode onwards. But<lb
                     break="yes"/>soon their skins turned cold, for there came<lb break="yes"/>a
                  galloping across <placeName ref="#theMoor">the moor</placeName>, and the black<lb
                     break="yes"/>mare, dabbled with white froth, went past<lb break="yes"/>with
                  trailing bridle and an empty saddle. Then<lb break="yes"/>the revelers rode close
                  together, for a great<lb break="yes"/>fear was on them, but they still followed
                     over<lb break="yes"/>the moor, though each, had he been alone,<lb break="yes"
                  />would have been right glad to have turned<lb break="yes"/>his horse's head.
                  Riding slowly in this<lb break="yes"/>fashion they came at last upon the
                     hounds.<lb break="yes"/>These, though known for their valour and<lb break="yes"
                  />their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at<lb break="yes"/>the head of a deep
                  dip or goyal, as we call<lb break="yes"/>it, upon <placeName ref="#theMoor">the
                     moor</placeName>, some slinking away and<lb break="yes"/>some, with starting
                  hackles and staring eyes,<lb break="yes"/>gazing down the narrow valley before
                  them.</said></p>
            <p><said>"The company then come to a halt, more<lb break="yes"/>sober men, as you may
                  guess, than when<lb break="yes"/>they started. The most of them would by<lb

                  or it may be the most drunken, rode<lb break="yes"/>forward down the goyal. Now,
                  it opened<lb break="yes"/>into a broad space in which stood two of<lb break="yes"

                     shining<lb break="yes"/>bright upon the clearing, and there in the<lb
