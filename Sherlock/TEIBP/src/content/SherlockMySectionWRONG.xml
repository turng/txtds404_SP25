                        have<lb break="no"/>any objection to my running my finger along<lb

                     until the original is available, would be<lb break="no"/>an ornament to any

            <p><persName ref="#Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName> waved our strange visitor<lb

                  of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in<lb break="no"/>mine,"</said> said he.
                  <said>"I observe from your fore-finger that you make your own cigarettes.<lb

            <p>The man drew out paper and tobacco and<lb break="no"/>twirled the one up into the
               other with surpis-<lb break="yes"/>ing dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers<lb

            <p><persName ref="#Holmes">Holmes</persName> was silent, but his little darting<lb
                  break="no"/>glances showed me the interest which he<lb break="no"/>took in our
               curious companion.</p>
            <cb/>
            <p><said>"I presume, sir,"</said> said he at last, <said>"that it<lb break="no"/>was not
                  merely for the purpose of examining<lb break="no"/>my skull that you have done me
                  the honour<lb break="no"/>to call here last night and again to-day?"</said></p>
            <p><said>"No, sir, no; though I am happy to have<lb break="no"/>had the opportunity of

                     Holmes</persName>, because I recog-<lb break="yes"/>nise that I am myself an

            <p><said>"Then had you not better consult him?"</said></p>
            <p><said>"I said, sir, to the precisely scientific<lb break="no"/>mind. But as a

            <p><said>"Just a little," said <persName ref="#Holmes">Holmes</persName>. "I think,<lb

               <p><said>"How can you say that, sir?"</said></p>
               <p><said>"You have presented an inch or two of it<lb break="no"/>to my examination
                     all the time that you have<lb break="no"/>been talking. It would be a poor
