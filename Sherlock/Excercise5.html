                        <p>MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon
                            those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at
                            the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick
                            which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine,
                            thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a
                            "Penang lawyer." Just under the head was a broad silver band, nearly an
                            inch across. "To James Mortimer, M. R. C. S., from his friends of the C.
                            C. H.," was engraved upon it, with the date "1884." It was just such a
                            stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry—dignified,
                            solid, and reassuring. </p>
                        <p>"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?" </p>
                        <p>Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my
                            occupation.</p>
                        <p>"How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back
                            of your head." </p>
                        <p>"I have, at least, a well-polished silver-plated coffee-pot in front of
                            me," said he. "But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's
                            stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no
                            notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.
                            Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it."</p>
                        <p>"I think," said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
                            companion, "that Dr. Mortimer is a successful elderly medical man,</p>

                        <p id="columnstart">well-esteemed, since those who know him give him this
                            mark of their appreciation." </p>
                        <p>"Good!" said Holmes. "Excellent!"</p>
                        <p>"I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country
                            practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot."</p>
                        <p>"Why so?"</p>
                        <p>"Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one, has been so
                            knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
                            The thick iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a
                            great amount of walking with it."</p>
                        <p>"Perfectly sound !" said Holmes.</p>
                        <p>"And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.' I should guess that
                            to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has
                            possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small
                            presentation in return."</p>
                        <p>"Really, Watson, you excel yourself," said Holmes, pushing back his chair
                            and lighting a cigarette. "I am bound to say that in all the accounts
                            which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you
                            have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are
                            not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people
                            without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I
                            confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt."</p>
                        <p>He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me
                            keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my
                            admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his
                            methods. I was proud too to think that I had so far mastered his system
                            as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took the stick
                            from my hands</p>

                    <p>and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with an
                        expression of interest he laid down his cigarette and, carry-ing the cane to
                        the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.</p>
                    <p>"Interesting, though elementary," said he, as he returned to his favourite
                        corner of the settee. "There are certainly one or two indications upon the
                        stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions."</p>
                    <p>"Has anything escaped me?" I asked, with some self-importance. "I trust that
                        there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?"</p>
                    <p>"I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erro-neous.
                        When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting y
                        fallacies I was occa-sionally guided towards the truth. Not that you are
                        entirely wrong in this in-stance. The man is cer-tainly a country
                        practi-tioner. And he walks a good deal."</p>
                    <p>"Then I was right."</p>
                    <p>"To that extent."</p>
                    <p>"But that was all."</p>
                    <p>"No, no, my dear Wat-son, not all—by no means all. I would suggest, for
                        example, that a presenta-tion to a doctor is more likely to come from an
                        hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are placed
                        before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest
                        themselves."</p>
                    <p>"You may be right."</p>
                    <p>"The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working
                        hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of
                        this unknown visitor."</p>
                    <p>"Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for 'Charing Cross Hospital,'
                        what further inferences may we draw?"</p>
                    <p>"Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!"</p>
                    <p>"I can only think of the obvious conclu-sion that the man has practiced in
                        town before going to the country."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column2" style="flex-basis: 450px">
                    <p>"I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in this
                        light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation
                        would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their
                        good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the
                        service of the hospital in order to start in practice for himself. We know
                        there has been a presenta-tion. We believe there has been a change from a
                        town hospital to a country prac-tice. Is it, then, stretching our inference
                        too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?"</p>
                    <p>"It certainly seems probable."</p>
                    <p>"Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the
                        hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold
                        such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country. What was
                        he then? If he was in the hos-pital and yet not on the staff he could only
                        have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician—little more than a senior
                        student. And he left five years ago—the date is on the stick. So on your
                        grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear
                        Wat-son, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable,
                        unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I
                        should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a
                        mastiff."</p>
                    <p>I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew
                        little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.</p>
                    <p>"As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you," said I, "but at
                        least it is not difficult to find out a few par-ticulars about the man's age
                        and profes-sional career." From my small medical shelf I took down the
                        Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several</p>
