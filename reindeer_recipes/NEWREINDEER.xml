                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>This text is a Reindeer Recipe cookbook that was created by the Great Northern
                    Dining Car Department in the early 20th century. The Great Northern Dining Car
                    Department is a part of the Great Northern Railway company, which was an
                    American Class I railroad that was created in the 19th century by <ref
                        type="note" target="#n4">James J. Hill</ref>, a Canadian-American rail
                    entrepreneur. This rail ran from Saint Paul, Minnesota to Seattle, Washington,
                    and was wildly successful for a majority of its existence. But since 1970, it
                    has undergone mergers and acquisitions and has essentially been erased, or it’s
                    at least not as visible as it once was.</p>
                <p>That’s why we think this text is so important. It’s so far from common thought,
                    why would you ever be thinking about the Great Northern Railroad’s Reindeer
                    Recipe from a century ago? Even though it’s in our archives, even though we can
                    access it with an appointment and a librarian, we still thought there was value
                    in republishing it, in breathing some new life into it. We just made it go that
                    much farther from being forgotten. Now we talk about it with our friends at
                    dinner, how we’re working on a reindeer recipe cookbook, now we research the
                    Great Northern Railroad, we read about the origins and progression of the entire
                    company. It’s these little, personal things that keep texts alive, it doesn’t
                    have to be on a widespread level.</p>

                    Alaska—nourishment—not gold—something to add to the enjoyment of life—something
                    that with a final analysis is found more precious than gold—something to delight
                    the inner man—Reindeer meat.</p>
                <p>The <ref type="note" target="#n6">Great Northern</ref> Dining Car Department,
                    ever on the alert to discover new and better foods to offer its patrons,
                    believes that Reindeer meat will be approved by all who crave something
                    different.</p>
                <p>The <ref type="note" target="#n5">Reindeer</ref>, as now raised in Alaska, is a
                    domesticated animal; has nothing of the wild animal taste—the meat is finer in
                    texture than beef and decidedly more tender—this is explained by the fact that
                    the Reindeer is a docile animal, seldom exerting itself to the extent of
                    providing ordinary exercise—therefore he grows fat and soft. Reindeer meat has
                    juiciness of beef with delicacy of flavor unequalled by beef or venison.
                    Reindeer meat is a happy medium between wild game and domestic meats. </p>
                <p>Reindeer meat is Alaska's latest and most promising contribution to its mother
                    country, and Great Northern Dining cars are happy in their ro le of introducing
                    it. We confidently predict a hearty reception. </p>
