                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>This text is a Reindeer Recipe cookbook that was created by the Great Northern
                    Dining Car Department in the early 20th century. The Great Northern Dining Car
                    Department is a part of the Great Northern Railway company, which was an
                    American Class I railroad that was created in the 19th century by James J. Hill,
                    a Canadian-American rail entrepreneur. This rail ran from Saint Paul, Minnesota
                    to Seattle, Washington, and was wildly successful for a majority of its
                    existence. But since 1970, it has undergone mergers and acquisitions and has
                    essentially been erased, or it’s at least not as visible as it once was.</p>
                <p>That’s why we think this text is so important. It’s so far from common thought,
                    why would you ever be thinking about the Great Northern Railroad’s Reindeer
                    Recipe from a century ago? Even though it’s in our archives, even though we can
                    access it with an appointment and a librarian, we still thought there was value
                    in republishing it, in breathing some new life into it. We just made it go that
                    much farther from being forgotten. Now we talk about it with our friends at
                    dinner, how we’re working on a reindeer recipe cookbook, now we research the
                    Great Northern Railroad, we read about the origins and progression of the entire
                    company. It’s these little, personal things that keep texts alive, it doesn’t
                    have to be on a widespread level.</p>

                    <item><label>James J. Hill:</label> He was born in Canada on September 16, 1838
                        and died in Minnesota on May 29, 1916. He was a rail entrepreneur
                        responsible for the entirety of the Great Northern Railroad and he amassed a
                        wealth of $63 million by the time he died.</item>
                    <item><label>Reindeer:</label> Reindeer are endogenous to subarctic regions,
                        much like some parts of North America. With this being said, the nearby
                        areas of the rail itself would’ve been close to reindeer populations, making
                        reindeer an extremely viable source of food, hence the entire cookbook.
                        Reindeer meat is high in protein, healthy fats, and vitamins.</item>

                    <hi rend="dropcap">A</hi> NEW discovery from Alaska—nourishment—not
                    gold—something to add to the enjoyment of life—something that with a final
                    analysis is found more precious than gold—something to delight the inner
                    man—Reindeer meat.</p>
                <p>The Great Northern Dining Car Department, ever on the alert to discover new and
                    better foods to offer its patrons, believes that Reindeer meat will be approved
                    by all who crave something different.</p>
                <p>The Reindeer, as now raised in Alaska, is a domesticated animal; has nothing of
                    the wild animal taste—the meat is finer in texture than beef and decidedly more
                    tender—this is explained by the fact that the Reindeer is a docile animal,
                    seldom exerting itself to the extent of providing ordinary exercise—therefore he
                    grows fat and soft. Reindeer meat has juiciness of beef with delicacy of flavor
                    unequalled by beef or venison. Reindeer meat is a happy medium between wild game
                    and domestic meats. </p>
                <p>Reindeer meat is Alaska's latest and most promising contribution to its mother
                    country, and Great Northern Dining cars are happy in their ro le of introducing
                    it. We confidently predict a hearty reception. </p>
