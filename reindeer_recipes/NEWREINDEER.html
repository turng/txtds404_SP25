The Great Northern Dining Car Department is a part of the Great Northern Railway company, which was an American Class I railroad that was created in the 19th century by <a class="link_ref" href="#n4" title="James J.

This rail ran from Saint Paul, Minnesota to Seattle, Washington, and was wildly successful for a majority of its existence. But since 1970, it has undergone mergers and acquisitions and has essentially been erased, or it’s at least not as visible as it once was.</p><p>That’s why we think this text is so important. It’s so far from common thought, why would you ever be thinking about the Great Northern Railroad’s Reindeer Recipe from a century ago? Even though it’s in our archives, even though we can access it with an appointment and a librarian, we still thought there was value in republishing it, in breathing some new life into it. We just made it go that much farther from being forgotten. Now we talk about it with our friends at dinner, how we’re working on a reindeer recipe cookbook, now we research the Great Northern Railroad, we read about the origins and progression of the entire company. It’s these little, personal things that keep texts alive, it doesn’t have to be on a widespread level.</p></section><section class="preface" id="index.xml-front.1_div.2"><header><h1><span class="head">Preface</span></h1></header><p><a class="link_ref" href="#n1" title="We decided to keep this beginning part even though the tone is a bit precarious (calling Reindeer) as it set a lighthearted and..."><span class="dropcap">A</span> NEW discovery</a> from Alaska—nourishment—not gold—something to add to the enjoyment of life—something that with a final analysis is found more precious than gold—something to delight the inner man—Reindeer meat.</p><p>The <a class="link_ref" href="#n6" title="Great Northern Railroad Now known as the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway.">Great Northern</a> Dining Car Department, ever on the alert to discover new and better foods to offer its patrons, believes that Reindeer meat will be approved by all who crave something different.</p><p>The <a class="link_ref" href="#n5" title="Reindeer Reindeer are indiginous to subarctic regions much like some parts of North America.

Reindeer meat has juiciness of beef with delicacy of flavor unequalled by beef or venison. Reindeer meat is a happy medium between wild game and domestic meats.</p><p>Reindeer meat is Alaska's latest and most promising contribution to its mother country, and Great Northern Dining cars are happy in their ro le of introducing it.
