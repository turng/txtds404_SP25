    <p>This text is a Reindeer Recipe cookbook that was created by the Great Northern Dining Car
     Department in the early 20th century. The Great Northern Dining Car Department is a part of the
     Great Northern Railway company, which was an American Class I railroad that was created in the
     19th century by James J. Hill, a Canadian-American rail entrepreneur. This rail ran from Saint
     Paul, Minnesota to Seattle, Washington, and was wildly successful for a majority of its
     existence. But since 1970, it has undergone mergers and acquisitions and has essentially been
     erased, or it’s at least not as visible as it once was.</p>
    <p>That’s why we think this text is so important. It’s so far from common thought, why would you
     ever be thinking about the Great Northern Railroad’s Reindeer Recipe from a century ago? Even
     though it’s in our archives, even though we can access it with an appointment and a librarian,
     we still thought there was value in republishing it, in breathing some new life into it. We
     just made it go that much farther from being forgotten. Now we talk about it with our friends
     at dinner, how we’re working on a reindeer recipe cookbook, now we research the Great Northern
     Railroad, we read about the origins and progression of the entire company. It’s these little,
     personal things that keep texts alive, it doesn’t have to be on a widespread level.</p>

      itself would’ve been close to reindeer populations, making reindeer an extremely viable source
      of food, hence the entire cookbook. Reindeer meat is high in protein, healthy fats, and

       Meat</span></h2>
     <p>Meat should be well skinned, neatly larded and pan closely covered during first part of
