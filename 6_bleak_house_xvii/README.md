Due Apr 28 @ 5pm:
Submit a transcription in plain text of all parts of the text you'll be working on (the easiest place to do this is right in Oxygen. Open a new file and go to the "New Document" folder. This time, scroll down and "Text"). Or as much as you can... This includes:

the main text itself
any relevant "preliminaries" you to include: title page text, any prefaces, etc.
text connected to images you'll be including (ie. captions, etc).
In short, all the text that you'll be marking up in TEI.

If you can't get to everything, that's okay -- you can keep transcribing after you submit this. The more important thing for this exercise is that you have a decision and system in place for your transcription.

You'll want to make choices about spelling/punctuation, errors, etc (that is, if you have any to make. If your text is modern and printed, you might not need to worry too much. If you're working with manuscript text, you'll have more decisions here). You can:

modernize, correct, clarify, in your transcription, if you want -- bearing in mind that you'll lose the original, but this is okay, if you're certain that you want to normalize the text to make it more readable.
copy the original exactly as you see it on the page, with a diplomatic transcription. This is fine, too, especially if you're sure you want to simply use the original text in your edition. It also leaves the option open of modernizing.
copy the original, but mark up somehow the parts that you think you'll either want to modernize or correct, or where you'll want to provide the modern version alongside the original. There is a technique in TEI for offering a <choice> between two texts: an original and a modernized version, or a original version with an error and a correction... This is useful since it leaves open the option down the line of offering two versions of your text: a diplomatic version and a modernized, corrected version (you can see this in action at the Petrarchiv: https://dcl.luddy.indiana.edu/petrarchive/content/c001r.xml#c001rLinks to an external site.. See at the top right, you can toggle between "diplomatic" and "edited" versions of your text).
Include at the top of your transcription a brief statement about the choices you've made.
