            <p>Charles Dickens is one of the most well-known English authors, who had a diverse
               writing career as a reporter, editor and essayist. He produced 14 novels, most of
               which were published in serial editions. This included a 20-month serialization of
               Bleak House published by Bradbury and Evans with illustrations by <ref target="#n3"
                  >Hablot Knight Browne</ref>. The story of Bleak House follows the course of a
               legal dispute in the British <ref target="#n2">Court of Chancery</ref>, as the <ref
                  target="#n1">Jarndyce family</ref> waits over generations to receive an
               inheritance they believe they deserve. The story is a commentary on the convoluted
               legal system in Britain, and the corruption inherent in it. </p>
            <p>Thanks to the <ref target="#n4">serial format</ref>, Bleak House reached a wide range
               of audiences. The critical perspective towards the legal system in Bleak House would
               have appealed to a more educated population. Furthermore, relatively afforable
               installments, public readings, and library lendings would allow the working class to
               access the novel. Eventually, Dickens' work would achieve a global audience.</p>
            <p>Through this edition, we are interested in examining the intertextuality between
               advertisements and different groups of readers, as well as the juxtaposition of
               advertisements and the prose text of the novel. Along the way, we provide access to a
               serialized experience of the novel, as a modern parallel to how Bleak House would
               have been read when it was first published in 1852. The digital edition also augments
               searchability and increases accessibility for a 21st-century reader.</p>
            <p>We choose not to modernize the text, since we wish to preserve the textual impact of
               the original 1852 publication. Thankfully, the language is not too far removed from
               what modern readers are comfortable with. To supply more context, we choose to
               annotate unfamiliar terms and concepts pertaining to 19th-century British legal
               culture and Bleak House as a larger text.</p>

                  <p>"In forming our general estimate of this writer, we wish it to be understood as
                     referring principally, if not exclusively, to 'Vanity Fair,' so immeasurably
                     superior in our opinion is this to every other known production of his pen. The
                     great charm of this work is its entire freedom from mannerism and affectation,
                     both in style and sentiment, - the confiding frankness with which the reader is
                     addressed, -the thoroughbred carelessness with which the author permits the
                     thoughts and feelings suggested by the situations to flow in their natural
                     channel, as if conscious that nothing mean or unworthy could fall from him. In
                     a word, the book is the work of a gentleman- one touch of nature makes the
                     whole world kin, and here are touches of nature by the dozen." -<hi rend="it"

                     which this medicine continues to maintain for the prevention and cure of those
                     disorders incident to infants; affording instant relief in convulsions,
                     flatulency, affections of the bowels, difficult teething, the thrush, rickets,

                     Bucket</persName> rises betimes in the morning, and prepares for a field-day.
                  Smartened up by the aid of a clean shirt and a wet hair-brush, with which
                  instrument, on occasions of ceremony, he lubricates such thin locks as remain to
                  him after his life of severe study, <persName ref="bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>
                  lays in a breakfast of two mutton chops as a foundation to work upon, together
                  with tea, eggs, toast and marmalade, on a corresponding scale. Having much enjoyed
                  these strengthening matters, and having held subtle conference with his familiar
                  demon, he confidentially instructs <persName ref="mercury">Mercury</persName>
                  <said aloud="true" who="bucket" toWhom="mercury">just to mention quietly to
                        <persName ref="sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester Dedlock, <ref target="#n5"
                           >Baronet</ref>,</persName> that whenever he's ready for me, I'm ready for
                     him.</said> A gracious message being returned, that <persName ref="sir-dedlock"
                     >Sir Leicester</persName> will expedite his dressing and join <persName
                     ref="bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName> in the <placeName ref="library"
                     >library</placeName> within ten minutes, <persName ref="bucket">Mr.
                     Bucket</persName> repairs to that apartment; and stands before the fire, with
                  his finger on his chin, looking at the blazing coals.</p>

               <p>Thoughtful <persName ref="bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName> is; as a man may be, with
                  weighty work to do; but composed, sure, confident. From the expression of his
                  face, he might be a famous <ref target="#n6">whist</ref>-player for a large stake
                  — say a hundred <ref target="#n7">guineas</ref> certain — with the game in his
                  hand, but with a high reputation involved in his playing his hand out to the last
                  card, in a masterly way. Not in the least anxious or disturbed is <persName
                     ref="bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>, when <persName ref="sir-dedlock">Sir
                     Leicester</persName> appears; but he eyes the baronet aside as he comes slowly
                  to his easy chair, with that observant gravity of yesterday, in which there might
                  have been yesterday, but for the audacity of the idea, a touch of compassion.</p>

               <p><said aloud="true" who="sir-dedlock" toWhom="bucket">I am sorry to have kept you
                     waiting, officer, but I am rather later than my usual hour this morning. I am
                     not well. The agitation, and the indignation from which I have recently
                     suffered, have been too much for me. I am subject to — <ref target="#n8"

                  <persName ref="sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester</persName> was going to say
                  indisposition, and would have said it to anybody else, but <persName ref="bucket"

               <p>As he takes his seat with some difficulty, and with an air of pain, <persName

                     officer,</said>
                  <persName ref="sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester</persName> observes, raising his eyes to
                  his face, <said aloud="true" who="sir-dedlock" toWhom="bucket">whether you wish us
                     to be alone; but that is entirely as you please. If you do, well and good. If

                     upon the matter, that very night. Now, only you put that to <persName

                     down to his chambers with the intention of saying something further to him,

                  which occasions him to utter inarticulate sounds. With such sounds, he now breaks
                  silence; soon, however, controlling himself to say, that he does not comprehend
                  why a gentleman so faithful and zealous as the late <persName ref="tulkinghorn"

                  know my business, and that's all I've got to say to you on that subject. Now about

                  says <persName ref="bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>; <persName ref="sir-dedlock">Sir
                     Leicester</persName> mechanically bows his head; <said aloud="true"

                     hundred pound. Why, it's an unreasonable proposal! Two fifty would be bad
                     enough, but better than that. Hadn't you better say two fifty?</said></p>

               <p><persName ref="smallweed">Mr. Smallweed</persName> is quite clear that he had
                  better not.</p>

               <p><said aloud="true" who="bucket">Then,</said> says <persName ref="bucket">Mr.

                        ref="mr-chadband">Mr. Chadband</persName>. Lord! Many a time I've heard my
                     old fellow-<term type="legal" ref="serjeant">serjeant</term> of that name; and
                     a moderate man he was in all respects, as ever I come across!</said></p>

               <p>Thus invited, <persName ref="mr-chadband">Mr. Chadband</persName> steps forth,
                  and, after a little sleek smiling and a little oil-grinding with the palms of his
                  hands, delivers himself as follows:</p>

               <p><said aloud="true" who="mr-chadband">My friends, we are now—<persName
                        ref="mrs-chadband">Rachael</persName> my wife, and I—in the mansions of the
                     rich and great. Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great, my
                     friends? Is it because we are invited? Because we are bidden to feast with
                     them, because we are bidden to rejoice with them, because we are bidden to play
                     the lute with them, because we are bidden to dance with them? No. Then why are
                     we here, my friends? Air we in possession of a sinful secret, and doe we
                     require corn, and wine, and oil—or, what is much the same thing, money—for the
                     keeping thereof? Probably so, my friends.</said></p>

               <p><said aloud="true" who="bucket" toWhom="mr-chadband">You're a man of business, you
                     are,</said> returns <persName ref="bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>, very
                  attentive; <said aloud="true" who="bucket" toWhom="mr-chadband">and consequently
                     you're going on to mention what the nature of your secret is. You are right.
                     You couldn't do better.</said></p>

               <p><said aloud="true" who="mr-chadband" toWhom="bucket">Let us then, my brother, in a
                     spirit of love,</said> says Mr. Chadband, with a cunning eye, <said
                     aloud="true" who="mr-chadband">proceed untoe it.</said>

               <p><persName ref="mrs-chadband">Mrs. Chadband</persName>, more than ready, so
                  advances as to jostle her husband into the back-ground, and confronts <persName
                     ref="bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName> with a hard frowning smile.</p>

               <p><said aloud="true" who="mrs-chadband" toWhom="bucket">Since you want to know what
                     we know,</said> says she, <said aloud="true" who="mrs-chadband" toWhom="bucket"
                     >I'll tell you. I helped to bring up <persName ref="miss-hawdon">Miss
                        Hawdon</persName>, <persName ref="lady-dedlock">her Ladyship</persName>'s
                     daughter. I was in the service of her <persName ref="lady-dedlock-sister"
                        >Ladyship's sister</persName>, who was very sensitive to the disgrace
                        <persName ref="lady-dedlock">her Ladyship</persName> brought upon her, and
                     gave out, even to <persName ref="lady-dedlock">her Ladyship</persName>, that
                     the child was dead—she was very nearly so—when she was born. But she's alive,
                     and I know her.</said> With these words, and a laugh, and laying a bitter
                  stress on the word <quote>Ladyship,</quote> Mrs. Chadband folds her arms, and
                  looks implacably at <persName ref="bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>.</p>
