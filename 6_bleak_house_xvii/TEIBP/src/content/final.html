         <div type="editorial-intro" style="font-style: italic;">
            <p>Charles Dickens is one of the most well-known English authors, who had a diverse
               writing career as a reporter, editor and essayist. He produced 14 novels, most of
               which were published in serial editions. This included a 20-month serialization of
               Bleak House published by Bradbury and Evans with illustrations by <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note-ref">Hablot Knight Browne<span class="note-popup">Browne was a British artist and illustrator.</span></span>. The story of Bleak House follows the course of a
               legal dispute in the British <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note-ref">Court of Chancery<span class="note-popup">The Court of Chancery followed rules to avoid a slow pace and
               inequities of common laws.</span></span>, as the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note-ref">Jarndyce family<span class="note-popup">The novel features the fictional case, Jarndyce and Jarndyce.</span></span> waits over generations to receive an
               inheritance they believe they deserve. The story is a commentary on the convoluted
               legal system in Britain, and the corruption inherent in it. </p>
            <p>Thanks to the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note-ref">serial format<span class="note-popup">Novels in the 1800s were often published in serialized format over a
               number of monthly editions. Individual editions usually ended with a
               cliffhanger.</span></span>, Bleak House reached a wide range
               of audiences. The critical perspective towards the legal system in Bleak House would
               have appealed to a more educated population. Furthermore, relatively afforable
               installments, public readings, and library lendings would allow the working class to
               access the novel. Eventually, Dickens' work would achieve a global audience.</p>
            <p>Through this edition, we are interested in examining the intertextuality between
               advertisements and different groups of readers, as well as the juxtaposition of
               advertisements and the prose text of the novel. Along the way, we provide access to a
               serialized experience of the novel, as a modern parallel to how Bleak House would
               have been read when it was first published in 1852. The digital edition also augments
               searchability and increases accessibility for a 21st-century reader.</p>

               annotate unfamiliar terms and concepts pertaining to 19th-century British legal

                   <p>"Amount serials, the most important in our eyes is the new edition of the <hi rend="it">Penny Cyclopædia</hi>, issued in seperate divisions, under the
                      name of the <hi rend="it">English Cyclopædia</hi>. The first monthly part
                      contains the com- mencement of the two divisions, <hi rend="it">Natural History
                         and Geography</hi>, beautifully printed. It is a new work, although based
                      upon the old, and those who desire to possess the Natural History, for example,
                      without encumbering themselves with a whole cyclopædia, may do so by the
                      present admirable arrangement. The excellence of the articles, and the
                      profusion of wood- cuts illustrating the Natural History, make us desire to
                      call the particular attention of our readers to this re-issue."</p>

                        instructive publication, bestowing time, and toil, and patience upon
                        enterprises that were often not less hazardous to the pocket of the undertaker
                        than they were useful for the education of the public, -- Mr. Charles Knight
                        has never flagged in industry. The <hi rend="it">Penny Cylopædia</hi>, is now,
                        under his care and editorship, rising from its ashes, revived and completely
                        modernised. This also is to be henceforth, under its new title of the <hi rend="it">English Cylopædia</hi>, classi- fied. Of the First Part we have at
                        present to speak, and from the specimen before us, we most conscien- tiously
                        and emphatically recommend these ample dic- tionaries upon special subjects of
                        almost universal interest, as by far the best that are likely to be pro-
                        curable for many years, equally full--and published for a price which, at the
                        present cost of production, after allowing for a most extensive sale, can be
                        taken strictly as the <hi rend="it">minimum</hi> of cheapness possible in our
                        day. If we did not hope that Mr. Charles Knight's ser- vices were to be yet for
                        many years devoted to the profit of the public, we should be satisfied to take
                        this <hi rend="it">English Cyclopædia</hi>, when completed, as the worthy close
                        of a long series of most noble endeavours and successes."</p>

                  <p>"In forming our general estimate of this writer, we wish it to be understood as
                     referring principally, if not exclusively, to 'Vanity Fair,' so immeasurably
                     superior in our opinion is this to every other known production of his pen. The
                     great charm of this work is its entire freedom from mannerism and affectation,
                     both in style and sentiment, - the confiding frankness with which the reader is
                     addressed, -the thoroughbred carelessness with which the author permits the
                     thoughts and feelings suggested by the situations to flow in their natural
                     channel, as if conscious that nothing mean or unworthy could fall from him. In
                     a word, the book is the work of a gentleman- one touch of nature makes the
                     whole world kin, and here are touches of nature by the dozen." -<hi rend="it"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note-ref">Edinburgh Review<span class="note-popup">The Edinburgh Review was a prestigious literary magazine that ran

                     for the deceased <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#tulkinghorn">Mr. Tulkinghorn</persName>

                     the shadow of a doubt <pb xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" n="516"/>that she had worn the young woman's dress,
                     unknown to her. <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester Dedlock,
                        Baronet</persName>, I did endeavour to pave the way a little towards these
                     unpleasant disclosures, yesterday, by saying that very strange things happened
                     even in high families sometimes. All this, and more, has happened in your own
                     family, and to and through <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock">your own
                        Lady</persName>. It's my belief that the deceased <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#tulkinghorn">Mr. Tulkinghorn</persName> followed up these inquiried to
                     the hour of his death; and that he and <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock">Lady
                        Dedlock</persName> even had bad blood between them upon the matter, that
                     very night. Now, only you put that to <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock">Lady
                        Dedlock</persName>, <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester Dedlock,
                        Baronet</persName>; and ask <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock">her

                     to his chambers with the intention of saying something further to him, dressed
                     in a loose black mantle with a deep fringe to it.</q></p>

               <p><persName ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester</persName> sits like a statue, gazing
                  at the cruel finger that is probing the life-blood of his heart.</p>

               <p>
                  <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You put that to <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock">her Ladyship</persName>, <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir

And if <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock">her Ladyship</persName> makes any difficulty about

                     as you called him (though he's not in the army now), and knows that she knows
                     she passed him, on the staircase. Now, <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir
                        Leicester Dedlock, Baronet</persName>, why do I relate all this?</q>
               </p>

               <p><persName ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester</persName>, who has covered his face
                  with his hands, uttering a single groan, requests him to pause for a moment. By
                  and by, he takes his hands away; and so preserves his dignity and outward
                  calmness, though there is no more color in his face than in his white hair, that
                     <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName> is a little awed by him.
                  Something frozen and fixed is upon his manner, over and above its usual shell of
                  haughtiness; and <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName> soon detects an
                  unusual slowness in his speech, with now and then a curious trouble in beginning,
                  which occasions him to utter inarticulate sounds. With such sounds, he now breaks
                  silence; soon, however, controlling himself to say, that he does not comprehend
                  why a gentleman so faithful and zealous as the late <persName ref="#tulkinghorn">Mr. Tulkinghorn</persName> should have communicated to him nothing of this
                  painful, this distressing, this unlooked-for, this overwhelming, this incredible

You'll find, or
                     I'm much mistaken, that the deceased <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#tulkinghorn">Mr.

                     have been going to reveal it on the very morning when I examined the body! You
                     don't know what I'm going to say and do, five minutes from this present time,
                        <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet</persName>; and
                     supposing l was to be picked off now, you might wonder why I hadn't done it,
                     don't you see?</q></p>

               <p>True. <persName ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester</persName>, avoiding, with some
                  trouble, those obtrusive sounds, says, <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">True.</q> At this juncture, a considerable noise of voices
                  is heard in the hall. <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>, after
                  listening, goes to the library-door, softly unlocks and opens it, and listens
                  again. Then he draws in his head, and whispers, hurriedly, but composedly, <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet</persName>, this unfortunate family affair

                     Tulkinghorn being cut down so sudden. The chance to hush it, is to let in these
                     people now in a wrangle with your footmen. Would you mind sitting quiet—on the
                     family account—while I reckon 'em up? And would you just throw in a nod, when I
                     seem to ask you for it?</q></p>

               <p><persName ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester</persName> indistinctly answers, <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#bucket">Officer</persName>. The best you can, the best you can!</q> and
                     <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>, with a nod and a sagacious crook
                  of the forefinger, slips down into the hall, where the voices quickly die away. He
                  is not long in returning, a few paces ahead of <persName ref="#mercury">Mercury</persName>, and a brother deity also powdered and in peach-blossom
                  smalls, who bear between them a chair in which is an incapable old man. Another
                  man and two women come behind. Directing the pitching of the chair, in an affable
                  and easy manner, <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName> dismisses the

                     pieces!</q></p>

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Now, when you're
                     ready,</q> says <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>, after
                  awaiting his recovery, <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">to

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Haven't I come to it,
                        <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>?</q> cries Grandfather
                  Smallweed. <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Isn't the
                     gentleman concerned yet? Not with <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#captain-hawdon">Captain
                        Hawdon</persName> and his ever affectionate <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock">Honoria</persName>, and their child into the bargain? Come, then, I want to
                     know where those letters are. That concerns me, if it don't concern <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester Dedlock</persName>. I will know where they
                     are. I won't have 'em disappear so quietly. I handed 'em over to my friend and
                     solicitor, <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#tulkinghorn">Mr. Tulkinghorn</persName>; not to
                     anybody else.</q></p>

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why he paid you for them, you
                     know, and handsome too,</q> says <persName ref="#bucket">Mr.
                     Bucket</persName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I don't care for that. I want
                     to know who's got'em. And I tell you what we want—what we all here want, Mr.
                     Bucket. We want more pains-taking and search-making into this murder. We know
                     where the interest and the motive was, and you have not done enough. If
                        <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#george">George</persName> the vagabond dragoon had any hand
                     in it, he was only an accomplice, and was set on. You know what I mean as well
                     as any man.</q>
               </p>

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Now I tell you what,</q>
                  says <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>, instantaneously altering his
                  manner, coming close to him, and communicating an extraordinary fascination to the
                  forefinger, <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I am damned if I
                     am a going to have my case spoilt, or interfered with, or anticipated by so
                     much as half a second of time, by any human being in creation. <hi xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="it">You</hi> want more pains-taking and search-making? <hi xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="it">You</hi>
                     do? Do you see this hand, and do you think that <hi xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" rend="it">I</hi> don't know
                     the right time to stretch it out, and put it on the arm that fired that
                     shot?</q></p>

               <p>Such is the dread power of the man, and so terribly evident it is that he makes no
                  idle boast, that <persName ref="#smallweed">Mr. Smallweed</persName> begins to
                  apologise. <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>, dismissing his sudden
                  anger, checks him.</p>

               <p>The advice I give you, is, don't you trouble your head about the murder. That's my
                  affair. You keep half an eye on the newspapers; <pb n="519"/> and I shouldn't
                  wonder if you was to read something about it before long, if you look sharp. I
                  know my business, and that's all I've got to say to you on that subject. Now about
                  those letters. You want to know whos got'em. I don't mind telling you. <hi rend="it">I</hi> have got 'em. Is that the packet?</p>

               <p><persName ref="#smallweed">Mr. Smallweed</persName> looks, with greedy eyes, at
                  the little bundle <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName> produces from a
                  mysterious part of his coat, and identifies it as the same.</p>

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What have you got to say
                     next?</q> asks <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>. <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Now, don't open your mouth too
                     wide, because you don't look handsome when you do it.</q></p>

               <p>
                  <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I want five hundred
                     pound.</q>
               </p>

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No, you don't; you mean
                     fifty,</q> says <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>, humorously.
                  It appears, however, that <persName ref="#smallweed">Mr. Smallweed</persName>
                  means five hundred.</p>

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That is, I am deputed by
                        <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet</persName>, to
                     consider (without admitting or promising anything) this bit of business,</q>
                  says <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>; <persName ref="#sir-dedlock">Sir Leicester</persName> mechanically bows his head; <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">and you ask me to consider a proposal of five
                     hundred pound. Why, it's an unreasonable proposal! Two fifty would be bad
                     enough, but better than that. Hadn't you better say two fifty?</q></p>

               <p><persName ref="#smallweed">Mr. Smallweed</persName> is quite clear that he had
                  better not.</p>

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then,</q> says <persName ref="#bucket">Mr.
                     Bucket</persName>, <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">let's hear <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="mr-chadband">Mr. Chadband</persName>. Lord! Many a time I've heard my
                     old fellow-<term xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="legal" ref="serjeant">serjeant</term> of that name; and
                     a moderate man he was in all respects, as ever I come across!</q></p>

               <p>Thus invited, <persName ref="#mr-chadband">Mr. Chadband</persName> steps forth,
                  and, after a little sleek smiling and a little oil-grinding with the palms of his
                  hands, delivers himself as follows:</p>

               <p>
                  <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">My friends, we are now—<persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="mrs-chadband">Rachael</persName> my wife, and I—in the mansions of the
                     rich and great. Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great, my
                     friends? Is it because we are invited? Because we are bidden to feast with
                     them, because we are bidden to rejoice with them, because we are bidden to play
                     the lute with them, because we are bidden to dance with them? No. Then why are
                     we here, my friends? Air we in possession of a sinful secret, and doe we
                     require corn, and wine, and oil—or, what is much the same thing, money—for the
                     keeping thereof? Probably so, my friends.</q>
               </p>

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You're a man of business,
                     you are,</q> returns <persName ref="#bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName>, very
                  attentive; <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">and consequently
                     you're going on to mention what the nature of your secret is. You are right.
                     You couldn't do better.</q></p>

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Let us then, my brother, in
                     a spirit of love,</q> says Mr. Chadband, with a cunning eye, <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">proceed untoe it.</q>
                  <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="mrs-chadband">Rachael</persName> my wife, advance!</q></p>

               <p><persName ref="#mrs-chadband">Mrs. Chadband</persName>, more than ready, so
                  advances as to jostle her husband into the back-ground, and confronts <persName ref="bucket">Mr. Bucket</persName> with a hard frowning smile.</p>

               <p><q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since you want to know
                     what we know,</q> says she, <q xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I'll tell you. I helped to bring up <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#miss-hawdon">Miss Hawdon</persName>, <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock">her
                        Ladyship</persName>'s daughter. I was in the service of her <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock-sister">Ladyship's sister</persName>, who was very
                     sensitive to the disgrace <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock">her Ladyship</persName>
                     brought upon her, and gave out, even to <persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" ref="#lady-dedlock">her
                        Ladyship</persName>, that the child was dead—she was very nearly so—when she
                     was born. But she's alive, and I know her.</q> With these words, and a
                  laugh, and laying a bitter stress on the word <quote>Ladyship,</quote> Mrs.
                  Chadband folds her arms, and looks implacably at <persName ref="#bucket">Mr.
                     Bucket</persName>.</p>
