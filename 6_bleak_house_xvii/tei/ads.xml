                  seperate divisions, under the name of the <hi rend="it">English

                  mencement of the two divisions, <hi rend="it">Natural History and
                  Geography</hi>, beautifully printed. It is a new work,
                  although based upon the old, and those who desire to
                  possess the Natural History, for example, without 
                  encumbering themselves with a whole cyclopædia, may
                  do so by the present admirable arrangement. The
                  excellence of the articles, and the profusion of wood-
                  cuts illustrating the Natural History, make us desire
                  to call the particular attention of our readers to this

                  bestowing time, and toil, and patience upon enterprises
                  that were often not less hazardous to the pocket of
                  the undertaker than they were useful for the education
                  of the public, -- Mr. Charles Knight has never flagged
                  in industry. The <hi rend="it">Penny Cylopædia</hi>, is now, under his
                  care and editorship, rising from its ashes, revived and
                  completely modernised. This also is to be henceforth,
                  under its new title of the <hi rend="it">English Cylopædia</hi>, classi-
                  fied. Of the First Part we have at present to speak,
                  and from the specimen before us, we most conscien-
                  tiously and emphatically recommend these ample dic-
                  tionaries upon special subjects of almost universal
                  interest, as by far the best that are likely to be pro-
                  curable for many years, equally full--and published
                  for a price which, at the present cost of production,
                  after allowing for a most extensive sale, can be taken
                  strictly as the <hi rend="it">minimum</hi> of cheapness possible in our
                  day. If we did not hope that Mr. Charles Knight's ser-
                  vices were to be yet for many years devoted to the profit
                  of the public, we should be satisfied to take this <hi rend="it">English
                  Cyclopædia</hi>, when completed, as the worthy close of a 
                  long series of most noble endeavours and successes."</p>
