                  Geography</hi>, beautifully printed. It is a new work,
                  although based upon the old, and those who desire to
                  possess the Natural History, for example, without 
                  encumbering themselves with a whole cyclopædia, may
                  do so by the present admirable arrangement. The
                  excellence of the articles, and the profusion of wood-
                  cuts illustrating the Natural History, make us desire

                  fruitful field of cheap and instructive publication,
                  bestowing time, and toil, and patience upon enterprises
                  that were often not less hazardous to the pocket of
                  the undertaker than they were useful for the education
                  of the public, -- Mr. Charles Knight has never flagged
                  in industry. The <hi rend="it">Penny Cylopædia</hi>, is now, under his
                  care and editorship, rising from its ashes, revived and
                  completely modernised. This also is to be henceforth,
                  under its new title of the <hi rend="it">English Cylopædia</hi>, classi-
                  fied. Of the First Part we have at present to speak,
                  and from the specimen before us, we most conscien-
                  tiously and emphatically recommend these ample dic-
                  tionaries upon special subjects of almost universal
                  interest, as by far the best that are likely to be pro-
                  curable for many years, equally full--and published
                  for a price which, at the present cost of production,
                  after allowing for a most extensive sale, can be taken
                  strictly as the <hi rend="it">minimum</hi> of cheapness possible in our
                  day. If we did not hope that Mr. Charles Knight's ser-
                  vices were to be yet for many years devoted to the profit
                  of the public, we should be satisfied to take this <hi rend="it">English
                  Cyclopædia</hi>, when completed, as the worthy close of a

	               <p>By W. M. THACKERAY.</p>
	               <p>"In forming our general estimate of this writer, we wish it to be understood as referring principally, if not
	               exclusively, to 'Vanity Fair,' so immeasurably superior in our opinion is this to every other known production
	               of his pen. The great charm of this work is its entire freedom from mannerism and affectation, both in style and 
	               sentiment, - the confiding frankness with which the reader is addressed, -the thoroughbred carelessness with which
	               the author permits the thoughts and feelings suggested by the situations to flow in their natural channel, as if
	               conscious that nothing mean or unworthy could fall from him. In a word, the book is the work of a gentleman-
	               one touch of nature makes the whole world kin, and here are touches of nature by the dozen." -<hi rend="it">Edinburgh Review</hi>.</p>
