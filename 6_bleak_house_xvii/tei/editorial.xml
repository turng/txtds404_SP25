            <p>Bleak House is a mid 19th century novel by Charles Dickens, originally published in
               serialized form. The story of Bleak House follows the course of a legal dispute in
               the British Court of Chancery, as the Jarndyce family waits over generations to
               receive an inheritance they believe they deserve. The story is a commentary on the
               convoluted legal system in Britain, and the corruption inherent in it.</p>

            <p>Through this edition, we are interested in examining the intertextuality between
               advertisements and different groups of readers, as well as the juxtaposition of ads
               and the prose text of the novel.</p>

         <div type="editorial">
            <p>We choose not to modernize the text, since we wish to preserve the textual impact of
               the original 1852 publication. Thankfully, the language is not too far removed from
               what modern readers are comfortable with. Instead, to supply more context, we choose
               to annotate unfamiliar terms and concepts pertaining to 19th century British legal
               culture and Bleak House as a larger text.</p>
