            <p>Charles Dickens
               is one of the most well-known English authors, who had a diverse writing career as a reporter, 
               editor and essayist. He produced 14 novels, most of which were published in serial editions. 
               This included a 20-month serialization of Bleak House published by Bradbury and Evans with 
               illustrations by <ref target="#n3">Hablot Knight Browne</ref>.
               The story of Bleak House follows the course of a legal dispute in the British <ref target="n2">Court of Chancery</ref>, 
               as the <ref target="n1">Jarndyce family</ref> waits over generations to receive an inheritance they believe they deserve.
               The story is a commentary on the convoluted legal system in Britain, and the corruption inherent 
               in it. </p>
            <p>Thanks to the serial format, Bleak House reached a wide range of audiences. The
               critical perspective towards the legal system in Bleak House would have appealed to a
               more educated population. Furthermore, the relatively afforable installments, public
               readings, and library lendings would allow the working class to access the novel.
               Eventually, Dickens work would achieve a 
               global audience.</p>

            <p>Through this edition, we are interested in examining the intertextuality between
               advertisements and different groups of readers, as well as the juxtaposition of
               advertisements and the prose text of the novel. Along the way, we provide access to a
               serialized experience of the novel, as a modern parallel to how Bleak House would
               have been read when it was first published in 1852. The digital edition also augments
               searchability and increases accessibility for a 21st-century reader.</p>

                  seperate divisions, under the name of the <hi rend="it">English

                  mencement of the two divisions, <hi rend="it">Natural History and
                  Geography</hi>, beautifully printed. It is a new work,
                  although based upon the old, and those who desire to
                  possess the Natural History, for example, without 
                  encumbering themselves with a whole cyclopædia, may
                  do so by the present admirable arrangement. The
                  excellence of the articles, and the profusion of wood-
                  cuts illustrating the Natural History, make us desire
                  to call the particular attention of our readers to this

                  fruitful field of cheap and instructive publication,
                  bestowing time, and toil, and patience upon enterprises
                  that were often not less hazardous to the pocket of
                  the undertaker than they were useful for the education
                  of the public, -- Mr. Charles Knight has never flagged
                  in industry. The <hi rend="it">Penny Cylopædia</hi>, is now, under his
                  care and editorship, rising from its ashes, revived and
                  completely modernised. This also is to be henceforth,
                  under its new title of the <hi rend="it">English Cylopædia</hi>, classi-
                  fied. Of the First Part we have at present to speak,
                  and from the specimen before us, we most conscien-
                  tiously and emphatically recommend these ample dic-
                  tionaries upon special subjects of almost universal
                  interest, as by far the best that are likely to be pro-
                  curable for many years, equally full--and published
                  for a price which, at the present cost of production,
                  after allowing for a most extensive sale, can be taken
                  strictly as the <hi rend="it">minimum</hi> of cheapness possible in our
                  day. If we did not hope that Mr. Charles Knight's ser-
                  vices were to be yet for many years devoted to the profit
                  of the public, we should be satisfied to take this <hi rend="it">English
                  Cyclopædia</hi>, when completed, as the worthy close of a 
                  long series of most noble endeavours and successes."</p>

	               <p>By W. M. THACKERAY.</p>
	               <p>"In forming our general estimate of this writer, we wish it to be understood as referring principally, if not
	               exclusively, to 'Vanity Fair,' so immeasurably superior in our opinion is this to every other known production
	               of his pen. The great charm of this work is its entire freedom from mannerism and affectation, both in style and 
	               sentiment, - the confiding frankness with which the reader is addressed, -the thoroughbred carelessness with which
	               the author permits the thoughts and feelings suggested by the situations to flow in their natural channel, as if
	               conscious that nothing mean or unworthy could fall from him. In a word, the book is the work of a gentleman-
	               one touch of nature makes the whole world kin, and here are touches of nature by the dozen." -<hi rend="it">Edinburgh Review</hi>.</p>

	               AND YOUNG CHILDREN IS ATKINSON AND BARKER'S ROYAL INFANTS'
	               PRESERVATIVE-Under the Patronage of the Queen.-The high and universal
	               celebrity which this medicine continues to maintain for the prevention and cure of those 
	               disorders incident to infants; affording instant relief in convulsions, flatulency, affections of the bowels, 
	               difficult teething, the thrush, rickets, measles, hooping-cough, cow-pox, or vaccine inoculation, and may be
	               given with safety immediately after birth. It is no misnomer cordial!-no stupefactive, deadly narcotic!-
	               but a veritable preserver of infants! Mothers would do well in always keeping it in the nursery. Many
	               thousands of children are annually saved by this much-esteemed medicine, which is an immediate remedy,
	               and the infants rather like it than otherwise.</p>
