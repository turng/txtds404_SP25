The publication will commence with Geography and Natural History, and on their 
completion the other Divisions will immediately follow. The work will be issued in
Weekly Numbers at 6d., the Geography and Natural History Divisions alternately, and in
Monthly Parts, at 2s., containing the two Divisions in equal proportions. Nos. 1 to 9, and
Parts 1 and 2, are published.

The plan of publishing "The English Cyclopaedia" in four Divisons has the obvious // quotes are lowercase caps

"Amount serials, the most important in our eyes is
the new edition of the *Penny Cyclopaedia*, issued in
seperate divisions, under the name of the *English*
*Cyclopaedia.* The first monthly part contains the com-
mencement of the two divisions, *Natural History and*
*Geography*, beautifully printed. It is a new work,
although based upon the old, and those who desire to
possess the Natural History, for example, without 
encumbering themselves with a whole cyclopaedia, may
do so by the present admirable arrangement. The
excellence of the articles, and the profusion of wood-
cuts illustrating the Natural History, make us desire
to call the particular attention of our readers to this
re-issue."

"We do not feel that it is employing the language
of exaggeration to say that the issue in a cheap and
greatly improved form of the English Cyclopaedia,
under the ediorship of Mr. Charles Knight, and with
the co-operation of Messrs. Brandbury & Evans, par-
takes of the character of a national undertaking. It is
the product of the widest and deepest learning of our
country, and must be ranked amonst the proudest
achievements of the time."

"One of the very first labourers in the great and
fruitful field of cheap and instructive publication,
bestowing time, and toil, and patience upon enterprises
that were often not less hazardous to the pocket of
the undertaker than they were useful for the education
of the public, -- Mr. Charles Knight has never flagged
in industry. The *Penny Cylopaedia,* is now, under his
care and editorship, rising from its ashes, revived and
completely modernised. This also is to be henceforth,
under its new title of the *English Cylopaedia,* classi-
fied. Of the First Part we have at present to speak,
and from the specimen before us, we most conscien-
tiously and emphatically recommend these ample dic-
tionaries upon special subjects of almost universal
interest, as by far the best that are likely to be pro-
curable for many years, equally full--and published
for a price which, at the present cost of production,
after allowing for a most extensive sale, can be taken
strictly as the minimum of cheapness possible in our
day. If we did not hope that Mr. Charles Knight's ser-
vices were to be yet for many years devoted to the profit
of the public, we should be satisfied to take this *Englihs*
*Cyclopaedia,* when completed, as the worthy close of a 
long series of most noble endeavours and successes."
