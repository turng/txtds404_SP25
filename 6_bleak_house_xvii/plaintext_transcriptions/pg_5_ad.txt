A NEW EDITION OF VANITY FAIR.<!--bserif-->
By W. M. THACKERAY.
"In forming our general estimate of this writer, we wish it to be understood as referring principally, if not
exclusively, to 'Vanity Fair,' so immeasurably superior in our opinion is this to every other known production
of his pen. The great charm of this work is its entire freedom from mannerism and affectation, both in style and 
sentiment, - the confiding frankness with which the reader is addressed, -the thoroughbred carelessness with which
the author permits the thoughts and feelings suggested by the situations to flow in their natural channel, as if
conscious that nothing mean or unworthy could fall from him. In a word, the book is the work of a gentleman-
one touch of nature makes the whole world kin, and here are touches of nature by the dozen." -Edinburgh Review.

THE BEST MEDICINE IN THE WORLD for INFANTS
<!--sc-->and young children is Atkinson and barker's royal infants'
preservative.- Under the Patronage of the Queen.-The high and universal
celebrity which this medicine continues to maintain for the prevention and cure of those 
disorders incident to infants; affording instant relief in convulsions, flatulency, affections of the bowels, 
difficult teething, the thrush, rickets, measles, hooping-cough, cow-pox, or vaccine inoculation, and may be
given with safety immediately after birth. It is no misnomer cordial!-no stupefactive, deadly narcotic!-
but a veritable preserver of infants! Mothers would do well in always keeping it in the nursery. Many
thousands of children are annually saved by this much-esteemed medicine, which is an immediate remedy,
and the infants rather like it than otherwise.
