            <h2>Editorial Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Kollege Kookery Kinks is a quirky, playful cookbook produced by the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) at the University of
               Washington (UW), published in 1920. It provides an array of recipes with
               practical tips and instructions for simple meals. This text was initially meant for
               the audience of young, collegiate women wanting to learn simple, easy recipes that
               require no prior cooking experience. This original audience reflects young women's
               domestic and social lives while blending with the trend of the rise of women in
               higher education. This cookbook provides simple recipes, but is also a cultural
               artifact representing the social lives, diets, and collective community of UW women
               in the early 1900s.</p>
            
            
            <p>Our edition of Kollege Kookery Kinks aims to provide readers with a more accessible
               format by digitizing the text for modern readers. We prioritized preserving the
               original text’s historical value and authenticity. Therefore, the audience of our
               edition should be able to glimpse what the early 20th-century cooking methods and
               diets were like. Readers can analyze and compare these recipes compiled in the 1920s
               to modern-day recipes and diets. The readers of our edition will primarily target
               contemporary UW students and can extend, but not limit to, researchers and UW alumni.
               We hope that making this text digitally accessible broadens the outreach to people
               outside the limited few who have access to UW’s Special Collections Library.</p>
            
            
            <p>Editorial choices that we’ve made were made with the intent of honoring the
               cookbook’s historical authenticity. We’ve retained the original recipes' spelling,
               grammar, format, graphics, and additional quotes. Annotations added to the footnotes
               provide further explanations of outdated terms or references. The sections we’ve selected to transcribe are “Dainty Desserts” and
               “Cakes”. This was chosen out of the appeal for the recipes themselves, and
               to align with the playful tone of the cookbook. Our edition of Kollege Kookery Kinks
               provides an authentic transcription, making this resource more accessible and
               user-friendly.</p>

                  department. It was the first women's organization on campus, and initially served
                  as
                  a religious organization that offered Bible study, devotional gatherings, and
                  missionary work, including teaching English to Japanese immigrants in the 1910s. Over
                  the years, the organization evolved from a religious group to a feminist organization
                  that is committed to women’s health, rights, employment, racial justice, LGBTQ+

               <li class="note" style="margin-bottom:1em;">Our text focuses on the "Dainty Desserts and Cakes" section of Kollege
                  Kookery Kinks, which often features recipes that require baking. In the 1920s,
                  electric ovens became increasingly common and revolutionized home baking by making
                  it
                  more accessible and efficient. Unlike traditional wood or coal-fired ovens, electric
                  ovens offered precise temperature control and consistent heat distribution. Today’s
                  readers of this cookbook can easily follow the baking instructions using a modern
                  electric oven. See Grove. </li>

                  honor. It was difficult to find information by searching the contributor’s name, but
                  the example of Mrs. J. Allen Smith shows that both students and wives of faculty
                  members contributed to this cookbook. See Arts
