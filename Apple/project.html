            Various Ways of Cooking Apples
            </h1>

      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">115. Pommes Au Naturel.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">The Evil One, who first offered apples to our universal mother, exemplified his
            serpent-like sapience by tempting her to try them off the tree: this, notwithstanding
            the enthusiasm we entertain for the culinary art, is unquestionably the ne plus ultra of epicurism in
            apple-eating. The learned tell us that apples, by keeping, become mellow; that time turns their
            natural acids into sugar; but there is a season for the perfection of apples, as for
            every other fruit; and when the period of their ripeness is past, a slow process of
            decay takes place - their rinds become cork, and their pulp becomes sponge. Oh! let
            me not eat of these tough, shrivelled, high-temperatured apples!- but let me taste
            them when all their summer lusciousness is fresh upon them; when their sparkling
            juice almost appears to effervesce as it comes in contact with the surrounding air;
            when, in short, they have attained maturity, and are, properly speaking, "in season."
            There are different kinds of apples ripe and in their prime from August to November,
            when, in the estimation of gourmets, they are considered to be the most correct fruit
            for taking with wine; their agreeable, but not strongly pronounced, acid augmenting
            the sensitiveness of the palate to the flavors which peculiarly characterize 
            
            the
             several varieties of wine. I must observe that inelegantly large apples are
            frequently introduced upon the dessert table; small 
            
            or
             medium-sized fruit have a much more dainty appearance, and are invariably
            to be preferred, either for their greater sweetness, or on account of the coquettish
            grace with which a tasty table-dresser can arrange them, peeping from among green
            leaves, or nestling in tufts of moss.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">116. Pudding À La Zouave.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Blanch half a pound of sweet almonds, pound them in a mortar, adding gradually half
            a
            pound of butter, four eggs well-beaten, half a pint of cream, half a pound of sugar
            and a glasss of raisin or Madeira wine. When this forms is a smooth paste, stir in
            a
            pound of pulped apples, which should have been previously boiled and allowed to grow
            cold. All the ingredients being properly mingled, put them into a well-buttered
            mould, and either boil or bake it for half an hour. In
            Marseilles, where we partook of this elegant compound, it
            was served with a sauce prepared with sugar and rum, in which a clove or two of
            garlic had been steeped. National prejudices did not prevent our pronouncing it
            delicious.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">117. Apple Ginger.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Take three pounds of Spitzenbergen apples, cut them
            into small pieces, put them into a dish, and pour boiling water upon them, then cover
            them up; clarify weight for weight of white sugar, and boil it to almost a candy
            height, throw in the apples, draining them from the water, and, without boiling, put
            them aside for half an hour, keeping them closely covered; then pour in a bottle and
            a half of Brown's tincture of ginger; boil it all until clear and of a proper
            consistency. When sufficiently cool, put it into bottles or jars. This economical
            preparation is very little inferior to foreign preserved ginger; it keeps well, and
            is exceedingly beneficial as a restorative for weak nerves.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">118. Pommes À La Vésuve.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Pile some apple marmalade high in a dish; get ready some macaroni boiled in water,
            but well drained, and afterwards sweetened with white sugar, and flavored with
            brandy; cut it into short lengths, but do not mince it; lay it as a bordering round
            the mountain of marmalade, plentifully dust the whole over with powdered white sugar,
            and on the apex form a crater with about half a dozen good-sized nubs of sugar; pour
            a good gill of brandy over the top, and immediately before serving set fire to it,
            and introduce it at table flaming.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">119. Apple Bread.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Weigh seven pounds of fresh juicy apples, peel, core, and boil them to a pulp, being
            careful to use an enamelled saucepan, or a stone jar placed inside an ordinary
            saucepan of boiling water, otherwise the fruit becomes discolored; mix the pulp with
            fourteen pounds of the best flour, put in the same quantity of yeast you would use
            in
            common bread, and as much water as will make it into a fine smooth dough; put it into
            a pan, and stand it in a warm place to rise; let it remain for twelve hours at least;
            form it into rather longshaped loaves, and bake it in a lively oven. This bread is
            very much eaten in the south of Europe.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">120. Pommes Farcies.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Take some large apples, pare them, and from the stalk end cut out a good deal of the
            insides without cutting the fruit through; fill the orifice of each apple with a
            mincemeat of cold roast goose, duck, or even pork, well seasoned with the best white
            pepper and a little sage; put the stuffed apples into a baking dish, with a bit of
            butter under each, and bake for half an hour in a gay oven, basting them as they
            require it. Grate a little toasted bread over them before serving.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">121. Pippin Tarts.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Take three large oranges, peel them very thin, boil the peel until it becomes soft,
            then take it up and chop it small; pare and core four dozen golden pippins, boil them with only enough water to cover them; when
            nearly done, add a pound and a half of brown sugar, the shred orange peel, and the
            juice of the oranges; boil it all together until smooth, and let it get cold; line
            your patty-pans with thin paste, and fill up each with the fruit. These tarts can
            be
            eaten warm or cold.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">122. Gâteau De Pommes.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Peel about two pounds of apples, bake or steam them until they are perfectly soft;
            add two pounds of white sugar in powder, with the juice and rinds of two lemons, and
            if requisite, a little water. Boil all this together for forty minutes, pour it into
            a mould; when cold, turn it out, cover it with a thick custard, and serve.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">123. Pommes Sautées.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Peel some very small and prettily-shaped apples, but do not take off their stalks;
            put them into a stew-pan of boiling butter, and shake them over a brisk fire until
            they are of a nice brown color; drain them, and arrange them neatly, with their
            stalks upwards, upon a thick layer of white sugar in a dish. Serve them either warm
            or cold.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">124. Simple Apple Pie.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Pare, core, and cut up the fruit into thin slices, lay it in your dish, and sprinkle
            some sugar amongst it; when full, put in the juice of two lemons, with a little of
            the rind finely shred, and some cloves or cinnamon in powder; line the dish and cover
            it with a good crust, and bake it for about an hour. Before serving, sift a little
            sugar over it.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">125. Beignets De Pommes.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Take some Greening apples, scoop out the cores with a vide-pomme, and cut the apples
            into thin slice; put them into some brandy, with the grated rind of a lemon, and
            place them over the fire for a few moments. Take out the slices of apple when they
            are pretty warm, and dip them into batter; then fry them in boiling lard. Free them
            as much as possible from all fat, and serve them thickly powedered over with sifted
            white sugar. Send them to table as warm as possible.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">126. Pommes En Compote.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Parboil some apples, then peel, core, and cut them into quarters, put them into a
            preserving pan with an equal weight of white sugar, adding a litte water; let it
            simmer slowly, and keep skimming it until the apples are quite done, then allow them
            to grow cold; arrange them in a jar; again boil the syrup until it is greatly reduced
            in quantity, and pour it boiling hot over the apples. When cold cover them up
            closely.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">127. Croutes De Pommes.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Cut some thin slices of bread into lozenge-shaped pieces, butter them on both sides,
            and lay them to fit in a well-buttered baking dish. Cut some middling-sized pippins
            into halves, hollow out the cores, and upon each piece of bread place half an apple,
            with the inside of the apple upwards. Put into each orifice a spoonful of good thick
            cream, and strew some pounded loaf sugar over the bread and fruit. Place it in a slow
            oven, and renew the cream and sugar as they dissolve. When done, arrange the lozenges
            of bread, with the apples upon them, in a clean dish, pouring over 
            
            them
             any juice that may remain unabsorbed by the crusts. Serve them warm.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">128. Apple Fritters.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Make a thick batter with six well-beaten eggs, a pint of milk, a little 
            
            powdered
             nutmeg, a glass of brandy, and fine flour enough to make it of the
            requisite consistency. Slice some good dressing apples into rounds, and dip each
            piece into the batter; then fry, in very hot lard, over a quick fire. The lard should
            smoke before the fritters are put in, otherwise they will not be of a good color.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">129. Gélatine De Pommes.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">In a pint of water boil one pound and a half of white sugar until it is reduced to
            a
            very thick syrup; then add two pounds of Newtown
            pippins, pared, cored, and cut into slices; squeeze in the juice of three
            lemons, and simmer gently until it is almost a paste; then pour it into a mould and,
            when cold, it will turn out a solid jelly. Serve it surrounded with scaled cream in
            a
            deep dish. </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">130. Apples With Pork Chops.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Sour apples sliced and fried in pork steak gravy are delicious. They should be served
            with the chops.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">131. Boiled Apple Pudding.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Line your pudding-basin with a good crust made in the proportion of eight ounces of
            beef suet to twelve ounces of flour; add a little salt; pare, core, and cut up your
            apples, and when filling your pudding, strew in some brown sugar and a little
            powdered cloves; cover it with a good thick top crust; tie it up, and boil for two
            hours.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">132. Pommes Soufflées.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Take your apples, pare, core, and boil them until soft enough to pulp through a
            colander; then sweeten them to taste, and stir in a little powdered cinnamon; put
            the
            fruit into a deep dish, and when quite cold, pour rich custard over it. Whip up the
            whites of the eggs remaining from the custard, and when they form a stiff snow, lay
            it daintily in small pieces upon the surface of the custard; sift some finely-
            
            powdered
             loaf sugar over it, and put into a moderate oven for a quarter of an hour
            or twenty minutes. This is equally good hot or cold.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">133. Stewed Golden Pippins.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Scoop out the cores, and, as you pare them, throw them into cold water to prevent
            their turning color. For every pound of apples weigh a pound and a-half of white
            sugar, boil it in a pint of cider until it becomes a strong syrup; skim it perfectly,
            and put in the apples; stew them very slowly, otherwise they will break; when clear
            they are done. Serve them in syrup.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">134. Preserved Apples.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Cut up a quantity of lemon pippins, take the parings
            and the cores and boil them, by themselves, for an hour; strain the water from them
            and add it to the sliced fruit, put it into an enamelled saucepan upon a slow fire,
            and let it simmer until the apples are done, then weigh a pound and a-half of sugar
            to each quart of fruit. Let it boil gently for an hour and a-half, paying attention
            that it does not burn. This is a very convenient preserve for keeping to use with
            damson or any other jams, which are generally too scarce to be employed freely in
            the
            winter season.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">135. Scalded Codlins.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Take some small codlins, wrap each in a vine leaf,
            and pack them closely in a stewpan; pour in as much cold water as will barely cover
            them, put them on the fire and let them simmer very slowly until sufficiently tender
            to take their skins off when cold enough to 
            
            do
             so. Well powder them over with sifted white sugar, and serve upon cream or
            with custards in glasses.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">136. Boiled Apple Dumplings.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Take some medium-sized apples, not too large, or they will not be nicely done; peel,
            but do not core them, as the pips enhance the flavor of the fruit; wrap each in a
            good beef-suet paste, made as for apple pudding (see No.
            131), put them into boiling water, and let them boil gently for an hour. Serve them
            as hot as possible, and always with the following sauce.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="recint">
         <h4 class="rectitle">137. Ginger Sauce.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Take half a pint of new milk, in which dissolve two ounces of fresh butter, and
            gradually dredge in enough flour to make it thick; then stir in two tablespoonfuls
            of
            white sugar, and two dessertspoonfuls of the best ginger in powder; stir it over the
            fire until it boils. This forms a most relishing sauce for apple dumplings, apple
            puddings, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

         <p class="innerrecint">Pare your fruit, and either scald or bake it until sufficiently soft to pulp it
            through a colander; sweeten it agreeably to taste, and fill your glasses three parts
            full with it; then plentifully sprinkle in some cinnamon and cloves in powder, put
            a

         <h4 class="rectitle">139. Chartreuse De Pommes.</h4>
         <p class="innerrecint">Well boil half a pound of the best Carolina rice in a quart of fresh milk, taking
            the
            greatest pains to prevent it from catching at the bottom of the saucepan. Pare seven
            large or nine middle-sized pippins; take out the cores, without cutting the fruit
            quite through; put a little raspberry jam into each hole, and fill up with cream.
            Edge a deep pie-dish with a rich light paste; lay in the apples, and level up the
            spaces between them with the boiled rice. Brush it over with the yolk of an egg, dust
            it well with pounded loaf sugar, decorate it with a few pieces of candied lemon or
            orange peel, and bake it for about forty minutes in a brisk oven. This dish is better
            eaten hot.</p>

            spoonfuls of orange-flower water; lay the apples in thin paste, fold it over them,

            it, and the grated rinds of two lemons; lay this thickly at the bottom of your dish.
            Mix a pint of cream, a pint of new milk, and the yolks of three eggs well beaten;
            put
            it over the fire, stirring it until it is just upon the boil; sweeten it with sugar,

            fresh butter, a gill of cream, the grated rind of a lemon, and some white sugar; mix
            all well together, squeeze over it the juice of the lemon; put a very light paste
            round the dish, and a few ornamental bars across. Half an hour in a brisk oven will

         <p class="innerrecint">Take some middle-sized or rather small apples; pare them, prick them well with a
            coarse needle, stew some sugar over, and bake them in a slack oven. While they are
            doing, boil half a pound of rice in a sufficiency of water, shaking it frequently.
            When nearly done, stir in three ounces of fresh butter, four ounces of white sugar,

            powdered
             cinnamon. Have ready a strong infusion of saffron, which strain into the

            shaking, but on no account stirring with a spoon or other utensil. When it is cold,
