            only. The purpose of this text is to track the differences in publishing from a
            serial format to one of the more standard novel, including all that comes with
            that. With serial publications, the texts we know today were separated into
            brief chapters and periodicals, only publishing a small section of the final
            text monthly over a large time span. Once the periodical had finished,
            advertisements began getting published for the full text edition of the novel,
            including in the final periodical of Bleak House. With this edition, we aim to
            display the functional differences in publicaition of different mediums of text,
            particularly focusing on the publication elements of the texts individually as
            well as the advertisements used in the periodicals and how these additions
            affected readership and the reader experience.</p>

            <p>“Among serials, the most important in our eyes is the new edition of the Penny Cyclopædia
               issued in separate divisions under the name of the English Cyclopædia.” — Leader</p>
            
            <p>“We do not feel that it is employing the language of exaggeration to say that the
               issue in a cheap and greatly improved form of the English Cyclopædia, under the editorship
               of Mr. CHARLES KNIGHT, and with the co-operation of Messrs. BRADBURY &amp; EVANS, dedicated
               by permission to Her Majesty, partakes of the character of a national undertaking.”
               — Weekly News and Chronicle. </p>
            
            <p>“The mass of information here presented in a beautiful type and a readable form, the
               cleverness and value of the illustrations, and the extraordinary cheapness of the
               whole, combine, with the publication advantages we have explained, to render the English
               Cyclopædia the best thing of its class, and one which we can conscientiously recommend
               to our readers.” — The Field.</p>
            
            <p>“This invaluable work has now reached the twelfth number ; and the public have been
               afforded ample opportunity of testing its merits as one of the most copious and complete
               Cyclopædias, and certainly the cheapest that has ever been issued.” — Dublin Evening
               Post.</p>
            
            <p>“The English Cyclopædia, Part II., is occupied with Natural History and Geography.
               The effect of skilful [sic] printing is here more than ever apparent. DR. LANKESTER
               has undertaken to bring the botanical articles up to the present state of knowledge.”
               -Gardener’s Chronicle.</p>
            
            <p>“Three parts are now before us; and, while they show perfection in typography, they
               evince the utmost fulness [sic] of knowledge in the writers- discoveries and details
               being brought down to the present day. The Penny Cyclopædia was undoubtedly the best
               general dictionary ever published; but we can say that this one promises to be still
               better.”-Liverpool Journal.</p>
            
            <p>“Of the First Part we have at present to speak, and from the specimen before us, we
               most conscientiously and emphatically recommend these ample dictionaries upon special
               subjects of almost universal interest, as by far the best that are likely to be procurable
               for many years, equally full-and published for a price which, at the present cost
               of production, after allowing for a most extensive sale, can be taken strictly as
               the minimum of cheapness possible in our day.”-Examiner.</p>
            
            <p>“The first six numbers of this publication are now before us, and if they are to be
               taken as a sample of the remaining numbers, it may truly be described as a wonderful
               production in a variety of ways; accuracy, the beauty and correctness of the wood
               engravings, in the Natural History portion; and though last not least its amazing
               cheapness.”-Dumfries Courier.</p>
