            This edition focuses on the advertisements that appeared alongside the original serialized publication of Bleak House written by Charles Dickens and illustrated by Hablot Knight Browne.
            This first edition was published in monthly parts between 1852 and 1853 and a well
            preserved complete set is available at the Special Collections of the University of
            Washington Libraries. While the novel itself has been widely studied for its plot,
            characters, and social commentary, the ads printed in each issue are often overlooked.
            These advertisements offer a lot of information about what people were buying, what
            they cared about, and how products and services were marketed to them. From cures
            for illnesses to new inventions and fashion trends, the ads show what everyday life
            might have looked like for mid-Victorian era of London.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            Our approach treats each advertisement as a single unit of analysis, carefully examining
            its components such as images, product descriptions, catalogs, testimonials, and more.
            What remedies for ailments were marketed to the public 150 years ago? Do they resemble
            the products sold to us today? How about their fashion, do some of those trends still
            exists today? What can these advertisements reveal about Victorian-era society, and
            how might those insights still resonate with our present-day culture? These are the
            questions we found compelling, and we hope you, as the reader, will find them just
            as intriguing.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            In creating this edition, our team chose to present a diplomatic transcription to
            preserve the original appearance and appeal of these advertisements as they were seen
            by the public. We maintained the original language and the layout of images alongside
            the text. In cases where words were hyphenated due to space constraints in the original
            print, we have standardized them into single words for clarity. We've also
            highlighted distinctive elements within the advertisements that we believe offer valuable
            opportunities for further analysis of print media from that era. We hope you enjoy
            this unique edition of Bleak House.

      Chas. Dickens, Esq. Sir,
      
      <p>We thank you for your new work. Though its name
         is Bleak House,we know well that its inmates will be warm and
         life-like. We thank you for it, not only for the pleasure that we, in common with
         all
         its other readers, shall receive in its perusal, but we thank you on more solid
         grounds; ,ve thank you for it as a matter of business.</p>
      
      <p>If it be true, that an observer must know of the existence of a place before he can
         arrange for visiting it, it must be equally true, that the public must be aware of
         the existence of an establishment before they can contemplate patronising it; and
         further, that they must be aware of the advantages offered by a particular concern
         before they will select that in preference to any other. On these grounds, then, we
         thank you for Bleak House in a business point of view, because it
         affords us an opportunity of conveying to all its readers the advantages or our
         Establishment, and the principles upon which it continues to be conducted.</p>
      
      <p>Many thousands of readers have, we doubt not, entered upon their tasks since even
         David Copperfield monthly appeared,
         between his green leaves, and some of these readers may note with favour the
         statement we here subjoin.</p>
      
      <p>We keep for the selection of purchaser all kinds or Tea and Coffee fit for use
         imported into this country, and we supply them at the most moderate cost at which
         they can possibly be sold.</p>
      
      <p>We have endeavoured to render ourselves particularly celebrated for supplying Teas
         of the most sound and excellent qualities.</p>
      
      <p>We have a Patented Invention for Roasting Coffee, Cocoa, &amp;c. in Silver. By
         this plan the ordinary evils of roasting such produce in a cylinder made of base
         metal are avoided, whilst the cost of the produce is not increased.</p>
      
      <p>We deliver by our Vans all Orders from any part of the Metropolitan Districts, within eight miles of St.
         Paul's, on tho day after such orders are given.</p>
      
      <p>We also send into the Country, free of carriage, all Orders, if they be
         accompanied by a remittance for payment, whether by half-notes, Post Office Order,
         or otherwise, provided the goods ordered amount to £2 or upwards.</p>
      
      <p>We sell our goods only for immediate payment. Our tariff of profit is fixed
         without allowing for the interest on capital necessary to support a heavy amount
         of debts.</p>
      
      <p>For the facilities that this excellent medium of publicity has allowed us for making
         known the above particulars, we sincerely thank you, and we trust and hope that by
         our care and attention, and by the excellence of the Goods we supply, those readers
         of Bleak House who may turn their favourable patronage to Number
         One, will never regret having glanced over the first page of its white paper,
         on this 1st day of May.</p>
      
      <p>Wishing that you may long live to give birth to heaps of Household
         Words, and to numerous Brothers and Sisters of David Copperfield,</p>
      We remain, Sir, Very respectfully, Your obedient ServantsDakin &amp; Company

      <p>
         Norton's Camomile Pills,
         The
         most certain preserver of health; A
         mild, yet speedy, safe, andEffectual Aid in cases of indigestion,
         And all stomach complaints,
         And, as a natural consequence,
         A purifier of the blood, and a sweetener of the whole system.
         Indigestion is a weakness or want of power of the digestive juices in the stomach
         to convert what we eat and drink into healthy matter, for the proper nourishment of
         the whole system. It is caused by every thing which weakens the system in general,
         or the stomach in particular. From it proceed nearly all diseases to which we are
         liable; for it is very certain, that if we could always keep the stomach right we
         should only die by old age or accident. Indigestion produces a great variety of unpleasant
         sensations: amongst the prominent of its miserable effects are a want of, or an inordinate,
         appetite, sometimes attended with a constant craving for drink, a distension or feeling
         enlargement of the stomach, flatulency, heartburn, pains in the stomach, acidity,
         unpleasant taste in the mouth, perhaps sickness, rumbling noise in the bowels: in
         some cases of depraved digestions there is nearly a complete disrelish for food, but
         still the appetite is not greatly impaired, as at the stated period of meals persons
         so afflicted can eat heartily, although without much gratification; a long train of
         nervous symptoms are also frequent attendants, general debility, great languidess,
         and incapacity for exertion. The minds of persons so afflicted frequently become irraitable
         and desponding, and great anxiety is observable in the countenance; they appear thoughtful,
         melancholy, and dejected, under great apprehension of some imaginary danger, will
         start at any unexpected noise or occurrence, and become so agitated that they require
         some time to calm and collect themselves; yet for all this the mind is exhilarated
         without much difficulty; pleasing events, society, will for a time dissipate all appearance
         of disease; but the excitement produced by an agreeable change vanishes soon after
         the cause has gone by. Other symptoms are, voilent palpitations, restlessness, the
         sleep disturbed by frightful dreams and startings, and affording little or no refreshment:
         occasionally there is much moaning, with a sense of weight and oppression upon the
         chest, nightmare, &amp;c.  
         It is almost impossible to enumerate all the symptoms of this first invader upon the
         constitution, as in a hundred cases of Indigestion there will probably be something peculiar to each; but, be they what they may, they
         are all occassioned by the food becoming a burden rather than a support to the stomach;
         and in all its stages the medicine most wanted is that which will afford speedy and
         effectual assistance to the digestive organs, and give energy to the nervous and muscular
         systems,-nothing can more speedily or with more certainty effect so desirable an object
         than Norton's Extract of Camomile Flowers. The herb has from time immemorial been highly esteemed in England as a grateful
         anodyne, imparting an aromatic bitter to the taste, and a pleasing degree of warmth
         and strength to the stomach; and in all cases of indigestion, gout in the stomach,
         windy colic, and general weakness, it has for ages been strongly recommended by the
         most eminent practitioners as very useful and beneficial. The great, indeed only,
         objection to its use has been the large quantity of water which it takes to dissolve
         a small part of the flowers and which must be taken with it into the2 stomach. It requires a quarter of a pint of boiling water to dissolve the soluble
         portion of one drachm of camomile flowers; and, when one or even two ounces may be
         taken with advantage, it must at once be seen how impossible it is to take a proper
         dose of this wholesome herb in the form of tea; and the only reason why it has not
         long since been placed the very first in rank of all restorative medicines is that
         in taking it the stomach has always been loaded with water which tends in a great
         measure to counteract, and very frequently wholly to destroy the effect. It must be
         evident that loading a weak stomach with a large purpose of conveying into it a small
         quantity of medicine must be injurious; and that the medicines must possess powerful
         renovating properties only to counteract the bad effects likely to be produced by
         the water. Generally speaking, this has been the case with camomile flowers, a herb
         possessing the highest restorative qualities, and when properly taken, decidedly the
         most speedy restorer, and the most certain preserver of health.
         These  pills are wholly camomile, prepared by a peculiar process, accidentally discovered, and known only to the proprietor,
         and which he firmly believes to be one of the most valuable modern discoveries in
         medicine, by which all the essential and extractice matter of more than an ounce of
         the flowers is concentrated in four moderate-sized pills. Experience has afforded
         the most ample proof that they possess all the fine aromatic and stomachic properties
         for which the herb has been esteemed; and, as they are taken into the stomach unencumbered
         by any diluting or indigestible substance, in the same degree has their enefit been
         more immediate and decided. Mild in their operation and pleasant in their effect,
         they may be taken at any age, and under any circumstance, without danger or inconvenience.
         A person exposed to cold and wet a whole day or night could not possibly receive any
         injury from taking them, but, on the contrary, they would effectually prevent a cold
         being taken. After a long acquaintance with and strict observance of the medicinal
         properties of Norton's Camomile Pills, it is only doing them justice to say, that they are really the most valuable of
         all tonic medicines. By the word tonic is meant a medicine which gives strength to the stomach sufficient
         to digest in proper quantities all wholesome food, which increases the power of every
         nerve and muscle of the human body, or, in other words, invigorates the nervous and
         muscular systems. The solidity or firmness of the whole tissue of the body which so
         quickly follows the use of Norton's Camomile Pills, their certain and speedy effects in repairing the partial dilapidations from time
         or intemperance, and their lasting salutary in fluence on the whole frame, is most
         con vincing, that in the smallest compass is contained the largest quantity of the
         tonic principle, of so peculiar a nature as to pervade the whole system, through which
         it diffuses health and strength sufficient to resist the formation of disease, and
         also to fortify the consitution against contagion; as such, their general use is strongly
         recommended as a
         preventative during the prevalence of malignant fever or other infectious diseases,
         and to persons attending sick rooms they are invaluable as in no one instance have
         they ever failed in preventing the taking of illness, even under the most trying circumstances.
         As  Norton's Camomile Pills are particularly recommended for all stomach complaints or indigestion, it will probably
         be expected that some advice should be given respecting diet, though after all that
         has been written upon the subject, after the publication of volume upon volume, after
         the country has, as it were, been inundated with practical essays on diet, as a means
         of prolonging life, it would be unnecessary to say more, did we not feel it our duty
         to make the humble endeavor of inducing the public to regard them not, but to adopt
         that course which is dictated by nature, by reason, and common sense. Those persons
         who study the wholesomes, and are governed by the opinions of writers on diet, are
         uniformly both unhealthy in body and weak in mind. There can be no doubt that the
         palate is designed to inform us what is proper for the stomach, and of course that
         must best instruct us what food to take and what to avoid: we want no other adviser.
         Nothing can be more clear than that those articles which are agreeable to the taste
         were by nature intended for our food and sustenance, whether liquid or solid, foreign
         or of native production: if they are pure and unadulterated, no harm need be dreaded
         by their3 use; they will only injure by abuse. Consequently, whatever the palate approves,
         eat and drink always in moderation, but never in excess; keeping in mind that the
         first process of digestion is performed in the mouth, the second in the stomach; and
         that, in order that the stomach may be able to do its work properly, it is requisite
         the first should be well performed; this consists in masticating or chewing the solid
         food, so as to break down and separate the fibres and small substances of meat and
         vegetables,
         mixing them well, and blending the whole together before they are swallowed; and it
         is particularly urged upon all to take plenty of time to their meals and never eat
         in haste. If you conform to this short and simple, but comprehensive advice, and find
         that there are various things which others eat and drink with pleasure and without
         inconvenience, and which would be pleasant to yourself only that they disagree, you
         may at once conclude that the fault is in the stomach, that it does not possess the
         power which it ought to do, that it wants assistance, and the sooner that assistance
         is afforded the better. A very short trial of this medicine will best prove how soon
         it will put the stomach in a condition to perform with ease all the work which nature
         intended for it. By its use you will soon be able to enjoy, in moderation, whatever
         is agreeable to the taste, and unable to name one individual article of food which
         disagrees with or sits unpleasantly on the stomach. Never forget that a small meal
         well digested affords more nourishment to the system than a large one, even of the
         same food, when digested imperfectly. Let the dish be ever so delicious, ever so enticing
         a variety offered, the bottle ever so enchanting, never forget that temperance tends
         to preserve health, and that health is the soul of enjoyment. But should an impropriety
         be at any time, or ever so often, committed, by which the stomach becomes overloaded
         or disordered, render it immediate aid by taking a dose of Norton's Camomile Pills, which will so promtly assist in carrying off the burden thus imposed upon it that
         all will soon be right again.
         It is most certainly true that every person in his lifetime consumes a quantity of
         noxious matter, which if taken at one meal would be fatal; it is these small quantities
         of noxious matter, which are introduced into our food, either by accident or wilful
         adulteration, which we find so often upset the stomach, and not unfrequently lay the
         foundation of illness, and perhaps final ruination to health. To preserve the constitution,
         it should be our constant care, if possible, to counteract the effect of these small
         quantities of unwholesome matter; and whenever, in that way, an enemy to the consitution
         finds its way into the stomach, a friend should be immediately sent after it, which
         would prevent its mischievous effects, and expel it altogether; no better friend can
         be found, nor one which will perform the task with
         greater certainty, than norton's camomile pills. And let it be observed that the longer this medicine is taken the less it will be
         wanted; it can in no case become habitual, as its entire action is to give energy
         and force to the stomach, which is the spring of life, the source from which the whole
         frame draws its succour and support. After an excess of eating or drinking, and upon
         every occasion
         of the general health being at all disturbed, these pills should be immediately taken, as they will stop and eradicate disease at its commencement.
         Indeed it is most confidently asserted, that by the timely use of this medicine only,
         and a common degree of caution, any person may enjoy all the comforts within his reach,
         may pass through life without an illness, and with the certainty of attaining a healthy
         old age.
         On account of their volatile properties, they must be kept in bottles; and if closely
         corked their qualities are neither impaired by time nor injured by any change of climate
         whatever. Price 13 1/2d. and 2s.9d.each, with full directions. The large bottle contains
         the quantity of three small ones, or pills equal to fourteen ounce of camomile flowers.
         Sold by nearly all respectable Medicine Vendors.
         Be particular to ask for "norton's pills," and do not be persuaded to purchase an imitation.

      <h1>A Clear Complexion.</h1>
      
      <p>
         Godfrey's Extract of Elder Flowers
         is strongly recommended for Softening, Improving, Beautifying, and Preserving the
         SKIN, and giving it a blooming and charming appearance; being at once a most fragrant
         perfume and delightful cosmetic. It will completely remove Tan, Sunburn, Redness,
         &amp;c.; and, by its Balsamic and Healing qualities, render the skin soft, pliable, and
         free from dryness, scurf, &amp;c.; clear it from every humour, pimple, or eruption; and,
         by continuing its use only a short time, the skin will become and continue soft and
         smooth, and the complexion perfectly clear and beautiful. In the process of shaving
         it is invaluable, as it allays the irritation and smarting pain, annihilates every
         pimple and all roughness, and renders the skin smooth and firm. It protects the skin
         from the effects of the cold winds and damp atmosphere which prevail during the winter
         months, and will be found beyond all praise to use as a Family Lotion on all occasions.
         Sold in Bottles, price 2s.9d., with Directions for using it, by all Medicine Vendors
         and Perfumers. </p>
      
      
      
      <h1>A Cure for Gout and Rheumatism.</h1>
      
      <p>
         "The Eighth Plague," said the learned Dr. Johnson, "is the Gout, and that man who discovers a Medicine to alleviate its torments deserves
         well of his country; but he who can effect a cure should have a Monument raised to
         his memory as high as St. Paul's, as wide as the Thames, and as lasting as time."
         Simco's Gout and Rheumatic Pills
         are sold by nearly all Medicine Venders at 1s. 1 1/2d., and 2s.9d. per Box; the former containing does for five and the latter for fifteen days; and so many individuals, who considered themselves martyrs to Gout or Rheumatism,
         are now ready and willing to bear testimony of the wonderful effects of Simco's Pills,
         that the Proprietor fearlessly challenges the whole world to produce Medicine which
         at all deserves to be compared to them. There are many instances in which person have been completely restored to health and activity by
         taking Simco's Gout Pills, who have suffered from Rheumatic Gout for several years, and had drawn on a miserable
         existence, having lost the use of their limbs, believing that death alone could terminate
         their sufferings.
         Whilst taking the Pills, no particular rules or restrictions are necessary, as they
         are warranted not to contain any preparation of Mercury whatever; they seldom produce
         perspiration, purging, or sickness, but invariably improve the general health, sharpen
         the appetite, and facilitate digestion. Those periodically subject to Gout, Rheumatic
         Gout, Rheumatic Fever, &amp;c., should keep these Pills by them, as by their timely use
         an approaching attack may always be averted, and the tendency of these complaints
         to attack a vital part be effectually counteracted.</p>
      
      
      
      <h1>Influenza, Coughs, and Colds.</h1>
      
      <p>
         Simco's Essence of Linseed
         is the most efficacious remedy ever discovered for the relief of persons suffering
         from Influenza; the first two doses generally arrest the progress of this distressing
         complaint, and a little perseverance completely removes it. Children's Coughs, as
         well as recent ones in Adults, will be removed by a few doses (frequently by the first);
         and Asthmatic persons, who previously had not been able to lie down in bed, have received
         the utmost benefit from the use of
         Simco's Essence of Linseed.
         Sold in Bottles at 1s 1/2d., and 2s. 9d. each.

         Narrative.
         "If beauty of design and execution, combined with elegance of narrative and trustworthy
         description, can be any recommendation to a book, it is sufficient to say that this
         excellent volume posseses every one of these features, and establishes its own character
         without the need of any further praise." -Bell's Messenger.
         "Mr. Bartlett has with success brought together in an effective and attractive volume,
         a series of written and engraved memorials of the early days of our faith, which cannot
         but find a welcome in many a domestic circle, and cheer with its reccolections every
         Christian heart, whilst it pleases with its artistic beauty the most careless inspectors.
         We close the book with regret, and recommend it without fear." -Britanica

         A Manual of the Anatomy and Physiology
         of the human mind. By Rev. James Carlile, D.D., of Personstown and Dublin, Ireland. Feap, price 5s. cloth.
         "Dr. Carlile has aimed at doing for metaphysics what Sir John Herschel accomplished
         for astronomy in his popular Manual, and Paley for his subject in his celebrated Evidences of Christianity. He has not merely compiled or analyzed, but has read and thought for himself, and
         what he writes, though no doubt directly traceable to other sources, is yet stamped
         with his own character and feeling." -- Gaurdian.

         is brought to bear upon things of no transient interest. It is one of the best characteristics
         of his labours, that he does not write for praise, but for the benefit of his felow-men

         [William Lee, of St. Johns College, Cambridge, was about the
         1589 expelled from the University for marrying contrary to the statutes. Having no
         fortune, the wife was obliged to contribute to their joint support by knitting;
         and Lee, while watching the motion of her fingers, conceived the idea of imitating
         those movements by a machine.
         The
         London Weekly Paper,
         And
         Organ of the Middle Classes.
         A Record of Political, Domestic, and Foreign News, Literature, Arts,
         Science, etc.
         Under the Direction of
         William Jerdan, Esq.,
         (Late Editor of the Literary Gazette.)
         To the Middle Classes.
         In offering the London Weekly Paper to represent you in that great and still growing power, the Parliament of the British
         Press, we are aware that, previous to giving us your sufferages, you will demand--and
         justly--a full, clear, and candid statement of the part we propose to act on this
         great stage of Social and Political Life. With candour then we say, if we are returned,
         (and as those Members of Parliament who represent the larger constituencies are those
         whose opinions are attached the greater weight, so the greater number of votes you
         register in our favor the greater will be our influence, and consequently our sphere of usefulness,)
         that it is our purpose to enforce two high principles: I. Social Improvement; II.
         Political Reform.
         With our Social Duties then we will commence. We desire to supply a want long felt
         by a large portion of the Public: -- viz, a Weekly Paper that shall at once embrace all the news and topics of the week, and, at the same time, maintain a higher literary character than has generally been assumed by the weekly press. It will be of the full size,
         consisting of sixty-four columns, printed on superior paper, from bold, clear type.
         As our London Weekly Paper is especially intended for the Family Circle, the utmost care will be taken to preserve,
         throughout, a strictly Moral Tone, and with this view, all advertisements of an objectionable
         character will be carefully excluded. The proceedings of the Law and Police Courts will be fully reported, and no pains
         will be spared to obtain the best and latest Foreign, Town, and Country News, with
         Accurate Accounts of Public Meetings, Lectures, Exhibitions, &amp;c. Carefully digested
         Reports of the Parliamentary Proceedings and Debates will also be given. Due attention
         will be paid to the Markets, Funds, Railways, Sporting Intelligence, &amp;c.
         We intend making the Reviews of New Books, Science, Archaeology, the Fine Arts, Music,
         the Theatres, &amp;c., especial features: this portion will be confided to gentlemen distinguised
         by their attainments in the Arts, Science, and Literature.
         A Principal Novelty in this Paper, distinguishing it from all others, will be the devotion, from week
         to week, of a portion of its Columns to the History of the Origin of contemporary events, with Biographical notices of persons lately sprung into notoriety. Thus, we shall not think it enough to record a passing occurrence, but when it possesses
         anny importance, make it a portion of our duty to give the particular of such event,
         and the cause which led to it. It has been a matter of complaint, that, in the newspapers generally,
         great political incidents as they occur are brought abruptly before the public, without that sort of information relating to their antecedents which would make them intelligible to the general reader; this defect we hope to
         remedy.
         But, while we devote a portion of our space to all these subjects, the Political Department
         of our Paper will be earnestly conducted, nor shall we shrink, in the slightest degree,
         from the responsibility attached to it. We will honestly advocate the great cause
         of National Progress, and we need scarcely add the continuance of the free and enlightened
         Commercial Policy which has so largely contributed to the present material comforts
         of the humbler classes, and thus to the general prosperity of the country: while we
         no less firmly support, on the other hand, the interests of Social Order against Mob
         Despotism, and the great principles of Constitutional Liberty against Individual or
         Combined Oppression.
         With regard to the Church, we profess ourselves Staunch Protestants, but we shall
         advocate the cause of Religious Liberty, and do all in our power to promote Reform
         of Abuses which have crept into Ecclesiastical Establishments. In short, we shall
         suport deliberate and well-conducted Reform wherever it is required, in Church or
         in State, in Law, or other Learned Professions, in Corporate Bodies and Institutions,
         in the Commerical and Colonial Relations of the Kingdom, in Education, and in everyhthing
         which regards the Social Condition and Social Comforts of our Countrymen. It is for
         them that our Paper is designed; we shall espouse the cause of no sect or party; but, whatever set of
         men may be in power, we shall judge every Measure of Government only by its intrinsic
         merits and the benefits it is likely to secure for the country.
         An Edition will be published on Friday, in time for the Evening Mails for the country,
         and the last Edition on Saturday evening at Six o'clock, which will contain the latest
         general news, the market and commercial intelligence, with quotations of prices corrected
         to the hour of going to press.
         Orders will be attended to by all News-vendors throughout the United Kingdom; or the
         Publisher will send it directly from the office upon the receipt of a Quarter's Subscription,
         viz., 4s. 4d.
         Money orders to be made payable to Frederick Tallis, 1, Crane-court, Fleet-street.

      Dickens is not the first author to publish a serialized form of the
      novel, this is attributed to an author known only as Boz
      through the publishing company Chapman and Hall. Boz's work, popularly known back
      then as the Pickwick Papers, were selling as much as 40,000
      copies per month in 1836. Nevertheless, Dickens is considered as the first already
      commercially successful author, as he already finished his 8th novel -- David Copperfield, who then published in serialized form. See
      Steinlight, 2006.
      Although this appears to be a letter to Charles Dickens, it is an
      adevertisement, nonetheless. In this sort of letter, the company thanked Dickens for
      his work on Bleak House and also mentioned his other popular work such as David Copperfield, to perhaps show sincerity, and then went on
      to promote and rave about their products. This strategy of connecting the
      advertisement to the source material, either to Bleak House or to Charles Dickens
      himself, is seen in other ads of those days. See for example Li, 2018.
