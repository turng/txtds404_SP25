            <p>Bleak House itself is a fiction about the lives of the rich and poor in London
               society during the Victorian era. However, our main focus is on the advertisements
               appearing before and after the serialized novel. These advertisements are appealing
               to a certain group of consumers during the mid-Victorian era of London. From our
               edition, readers would be able to peek into the world of 1852 when Bleak House was
               being published as a serial. The advertisements present in Bleak House are an
               artifact of that time; though they were likely ignored during it, they now provide a
               unique window into that time period. The audience for this edition would likely be
               people researching this time period rather than people who want to read Bleak House
               as a text; this means that it would lend itself moreso to scholars rather than
               laypeople.</p>

         <div type="introduction">
            <p> This edition focuses on the advertisements that appeared alongside the original <ref
                  type="note" target="#n1">serialized publication</ref> of Bleak House written by
               Charles Dickens and illustrated by Hablot Knight Browne. This first edition was
               published in monthly parts between 1852 and 1853 and a well preserved complete set is
               available at the Special Collections of the University of Washington Libraries. While
               the novel itself has been widely studied for its plot, characters, and social
               commentary, the ads printed in each issue are often overlooked. These advertisements
               offer a lot of information about what people were buying, what they cared about, and
               how products and services were marketed to them. From cures for illnesses to new
               inventions and fashion trends, the ads show what everyday life might have looked like
               for mid-Victorian era of London. </p>
            <p> Our approach treats each advertisement as a single unit of analysis, carefully
               examining its components such as images, product descriptions, catalogs,
               testimonials, and more. What remedies for ailments were marketed to the public 150
               years ago? Do they resemble the products sold to us today? How about their fashion,
               do some of those trends still exists today? What can these advertisements reveal
               about Victorian-era society, and how might those insights still resonate with our
               present-day culture? These are the questions we found compelling, and we hope you, as
               the reader, will find them just as intriguing. </p>
            <p> In creating this edition, our team chose to present a diplomatic transcription to
               preserve the original appearance and appeal of these advertisements as they were seen
               by the public. We maintained the original language and the layout of images alongside
               the text. In cases where words were hyphenated due to space constraints in the
               original print, we have standardized them into single words for clarity. We've also
               highlighted distinctive elements within the advertisements that we believe offer
               valuable opportunities for further analysis of print media from that era. We hope you
               enjoy this unique edition of Bleak House. </p>

            <p><ref type="note" target="#n2">We thank you for your new work</ref>. Though its name
               is <q rend="ac">Bleak House,</q>we know well that its inmates will be warm and
               life-like. We thank you for it, not only for the pleasure that we, in common with all
               its other readers, shall receive in its perusal, but we thank you on more solid
               grounds; ,ve thank you for it as a matter of business.</p>
            <p>If it be true, that an observer must know of the existence of a place before he can
               arrange for visiting it, it must be equally true, that the public must be aware of
               the existence of an establishment before they can contemplate patronising it; and
               further, that they must be aware of the advantages offered by a particular concern
               before they will select that in preference to any other. On these grounds, then, we
               thank you for <q rend="ac">Bleak House</q> in a business point of view, because it
               affords us an opportunity of conveying to all its readers the advantages or our
               Establishment, and the principles upon which it continues to be conducted.</p>
            <p>Many thousands of readers have, we doubt not, entered upon their tasks since even <q
                  rend="ac"><name type="person">David Copperfield</name></q> monthly appeared,
               between his <q>green leaves,</q> and some of these readers may note with favour the
               statement we here subjoin.</p>
            <p><q>We keep for the selection of purchaser all kinds or Tea and Coffee fit for use
                  imported into this country, and we supply them at the most moderate cost at which
                  they can possibly be sold.</q></p>
            <p><q>We have endeavoured to render ourselves particularly celebrated for supplying Teas
                  of the most sound and excellent qualities.</q></p>
            <p><q>We have a Patented Invention for Roasting Coffee, Cocoa, &amp;c. in Silver. By
                  this plan the ordinary evils of roasting such produce in a cylinder made of base
                  metal are avoided, whilst the cost of the produce is not increased.</q></p>
            <p><q>We deliver by our Vans all Orders from any part of the <name type="place"
                     >Metropolitan Districts</name>, within eight miles of <name type="place">St.

            <p><q>We also send into the Country, free of carriage, all Orders, if they be
                  accompanied by a remittance for payment, whether by half-notes, Post Office Order,
                  or otherwise, provided the goods ordered amount to £2 or upwards.</q></p>
            <p><q>We sell our goods only for immediate payment. Our tariff of profit is fixed
                  without allowing for the interest on capital necessary to support a heavy amount
                  of debts.</q></p>
            <p>For the facilities that this excellent medium of publicity has allowed us for making
               known the above particulars, we sincerely thank you, and we trust and hope that by
               our care and attention, and by the excellence of the Goods we supply, those readers
               of <q rend="ac">Bleak House</q> who may turn their favourable patronage to <q>Number

               juices in the stomach to convert what we eat and drink into healthy matter, for the
               proper nourishment of the whole system. It is caused by every thing which weakens the
               system in general, or the stomach in particular. From it proceed nearly all diseases
               to which we are liable; for it is very certain, that if we could always keep the
               stomach right we should only die by old age or accident. Indigestion produces a great
               variety of unpleasant sensations: amongst the prominent of its miserable effects are
               a want of, or an inordinate, appetite, sometimes attended with a constant craving for
               drink, a distension or feeling enlargement of the stomach, flatulency, heartburn,
               pains in the stomach, acidity, unpleasant taste in the mouth, perhaps sickness,
               rumbling noise in the bowels: in some cases of depraved digestions there is nearly a
               complete disrelish for food, but still the appetite is not greatly impaired, as at
               the stated period of meals persons so afflicted can eat heartily, although without
               much gratification; a long train of nervous symptoms are also frequent attendants,
               general debility, great languidess, and incapacity for exertion. The minds of persons
               so afflicted frequently become irraitable and desponding, and great anxiety is
               observable in the countenance; they appear thoughtful, melancholy, and dejected,
               under great apprehension of some imaginary danger, will start at any unexpected noise
               or occurrence, and become so agitated that they require some time to calm and collect
               themselves; yet for all this the mind is exhilarated without much difficulty;
               pleasing events, society, will for a time dissipate all appearance of disease; but
               the excitement produced by an agreeable change vanishes soon after the cause has gone
               by. Other symptoms are, voilent palpitations, restlessness, the sleep disturbed by
               frightful dreams and startings, and affording little or no refreshment: occasionally
               there is much moaning, with a sense of weight and oppression upon the chest,
               nightmare, &amp;c.<lb/> It is almost impossible to enumerate all the symptoms of this
               first invader upon the constitution, as in a hundred cases of <emph rend="ital"
                  >Indigestion</emph> there will probably be something peculiar to each; but, be
               they what they may, they are all occassioned by the food becoming a burden rather
               than a support to the stomach; and in all its stages the medicine most wanted is that
               which will afford speedy and effectual assistance to the digestive organs, and give
               energy to the nervous and muscular systems,-nothing can more speedily or with more
               certainty effect so desirable an object than <emph rend="ital">Norton's Extract of

               indigestion, gout in the stomach, windy colic, and general weakness, it has for ages
               been strongly recommended by the most eminent practitioners as very useful and
               beneficial. The great, indeed only, objection to its use has been the large quantity
               of water which it takes to dissolve a small part of the flowers and which must be
               taken with it into the<pb n="59"/><fw type="page_number" place="top_right">2</fw>
               stomach. It requires a quarter of a pint of boiling water to dissolve the soluble
               portion of one drachm of camomile flowers; and, when one or even two ounces may be
               taken with advantage, it must at once be seen how impossible it is to take a proper
               dose of this wholesome herb in the form of tea; and the only reason why it has not
               long since been placed the very first in rank of all restorative medicines is that in
               taking it the stomach has always been loaded with water which tends in a great
               measure to counteract, and very frequently wholly to destroy the effect. It must be
               evident that loading a weak stomach with a large purpose of conveying into it a small
               quantity of medicine must be injurious; and that the medicines must possess powerful
               renovating properties only to counteract the bad effects likely to be produced by the
               water. Generally speaking, this has been the case with camomile flowers, a herb
               possessing the highest restorative qualities, and when properly taken, decidedly the
               most speedy restorer, and the most certain preserver of health.<lb/> These <emph
                  rend="sc"> pills</emph> are wholly <emph rend="sc">camomile</emph>, prepared by a
               peculiar process, accidentally discovered, and known only to the proprietor, and
               which he firmly believes to be one of the most valuable modern discoveries in
               medicine, by which all the essential and extractice matter of more than an ounce of
               the flowers is concentrated in four moderate-sized pills. Experience has afforded the
               most ample proof that they possess all the fine aromatic and stomachic properties for
               which the herb has been esteemed; and, as they are taken into the stomach
               unencumbered by any diluting or indigestible substance, in the same degree has their
               enefit been more immediate and decided. Mild in their operation and pleasant in their
               effect, they may be taken at any age, and under any circumstance, without danger or
               inconvenience. A person exposed to cold and wet a whole day or night could not
               possibly receive any injury from taking them, but, on the contrary, they would
               effectually prevent a cold being taken. After a long acquaintance with and strict
               observance of the medicinal properties of <emph rend="ital">Norton's Camomile
                  Pills</emph>, it is only doing them justice to say, that they are really the most
               valuable of all <emph rend="sc">tonic medicines</emph>. By the word tonic is meant a
               medicine which gives strength to the stomach sufficient to digest in proper
               quantities all wholesome food, which increases the power of every nerve and muscle of
               the human body, or, in other words, invigorates the nervous and muscular systems. The
               solidity or firmness of the whole tissue of the body which so quickly follows the use
               of <emph rend="ital">Norton's Camomile Pills</emph>, their certain and speedy effects
               in repairing the partial dilapidations from time or intemperance, and their lasting
               salutary in fluence on the whole frame, is most con vincing, that in the smallest
               compass is contained the largest quantity of the tonic principle, of so peculiar a
               nature as to pervade the whole system, through which it diffuses health and strength
               sufficient to resist the formation of disease, and also to fortify the consitution
               against contagion; as such, their general use is strongly recommended as a
               preventative during the prevalence of malignant fever or other infectious diseases,
               and to persons attending sick rooms they are invaluable as in no one instance have
               they ever failed in preventing the taking of illness, even under the most trying
               circumstances.<lb/> As <emph rend="ital"> Norton's Camomile Pills</emph> are
               particularly recommended for all stomach complaints or indigestion, it will probably
               be expected that some advice should be given respecting diet, though after all that
               has been written upon the subject, after the publication of volume upon volume, after
               the country has, as it were, been inundated with practical essays on diet, as a means
               of prolonging life, it would be unnecessary to say more, did we not feel it our duty
               to make the humble endeavor of inducing the public to regard them not, but to adopt
               that course which is dictated by nature, by reason, and common sense. Those persons
               who study the wholesomes, and are governed by the opinions of writers on diet, are
               uniformly both unhealthy in body and weak in mind. There can be no doubt that the
               palate is designed to inform us what is proper for the stomach, and of course that
               must best instruct us what food to take and what to avoid: we want no other adviser.
               Nothing can be more clear than that those articles which are agreeable to the taste
               were by nature intended for our food and sustenance, whether liquid or solid, foreign
               or of native production: if they are pure and unadulterated, no harm need be dreaded
               by their<pb n="60"/><fw type="page_number" place="top_right">3</fw> use; they will
               only injure by abuse. Consequently, whatever the palate approves, eat and drink
               always in moderation, but never in excess; keeping in mind that the first process of
               digestion is performed in the mouth, the second in the stomach; and that, in order
               that the stomach may be able to do its work properly, it is requisite the first
               should be well performed; this consists in masticating or chewing the solid food, so
               as to break down and separate the fibres and small substances of meat and vegetables,
               mixing them well, and blending the whole together before they are swallowed; and it
               is particularly urged upon all to take plenty of time to their meals and never eat in
               haste. If you conform to this short and simple, but comprehensive advice, and find
               that there are various things which others eat and drink with pleasure and without
               inconvenience, and which would be pleasant to yourself only that they disagree, you
               may at once conclude that the fault is in the stomach, that it does not possess the
               power which it ought to do, that it wants assistance, and the sooner that assistance
               is afforded the better. A very short trial of this medicine will best prove how soon
               it will put the stomach in a condition to perform with ease all the work which nature
               intended for it. By its use you will soon be able to enjoy, in moderation, whatever
               is agreeable to the taste, and unable to name one individual article of food which
               disagrees with or sits unpleasantly on the stomach. Never forget that a small meal
               well digested affords more nourishment to the system than a large one, even of the
               same food, when digested imperfectly. Let the dish be ever so delicious, ever so
               enticing a variety offered, the bottle ever so enchanting, never forget that
               temperance tends to preserve health, and that health is the soul of enjoyment. But
               should an impropriety be at any time, or ever so often, committed, by which the
               stomach becomes overloaded or disordered, render it immediate aid by taking a dose of
                  <emph rend="ital">Norton's Camomile Pills</emph>, which will so promtly assist in
               carrying off the burden thus imposed upon it that all will soon be right again.<lb/>
               It is most certainly true that every person in his lifetime consumes a quantity of
               noxious matter, which if taken at one meal would be fatal; it is these small
               quantities of noxious matter, which are introduced into our food, either by accident
               or wilful adulteration, which we find so often upset the stomach, and not
               unfrequently lay the foundation of illness, and perhaps final ruination to health. To
               preserve the constitution, it should be our constant care, if possible, to counteract
               the effect of these small quantities of unwholesome matter; and whenever, in that
               way, an enemy to the consitution finds its way into the stomach, a friend should be
               immediately sent after it, which would prevent its mischievous effects, and expel it
               altogether; no better friend can be found, nor one which will perform the task with
               greater certainty, than <emph rend="sc">norton's camomile pills</emph>. And let it be
               observed that the longer this medicine is taken the less it will be wanted; it can in
               no case become habitual, as its entire action is to give energy and force to the
               stomach, which is the spring of life, the source from which the whole frame draws its
               succour and support. After an excess of eating or drinking, and upon every occasion
               of the general health being at all disturbed, these <emph rend="sc">pills</emph>
               should be immediately taken, as they will stop and eradicate disease at its
               commencement. Indeed it is most confidently asserted, that by the timely use of this
               medicine only, and a common degree of caution, any person may enjoy all the comforts
               within his reach, may pass through life without an illness, and with the certainty of

               <emph rend="medFont ac">To the Middle Classes.</emph><lb/> In offering the <emph
                  rend="sc">London Weekly Paper</emph> to represent you in that great and still
               growing power, the Parliament of the British Press, we are aware that, previous to
               giving us your sufferages, you will demand--and justly--a full, clear, and candid
               statement of the part we propose to act on this great stage of Social and Political
               Life. With candour then we say, if we are returned, (and as those Members of
               Parliament who represent the larger constituencies are those whose opinions are
               attached the greater weight, so the greater number of votes you register in <pb
                  n="67"/>our favor the greater will be our influence, and consequently our sphere
               of usefulness,) that it is our purpose to enforce two high principles: I. Social
               Improvement; II. Political Reform.<lb/> With our Social Duties then we will commence.
               We desire to supply a want long felt by a large portion of the Public: -- <emph
                  rend="ital">viz</emph>, a <emph rend="sc">Weekly Paper</emph> that shall at once
               embrace all the <emph rend="ital">news and topics of the week</emph>, and, at the
               same time, maintain a <emph rend="ital">higher literary character</emph> than has
               generally been assumed by the weekly press. It will be of the full size, consisting
               of sixty-four columns, printed on superior paper, from bold, clear type.<lb/> As our
                  <emph rend="sc">London Weekly Paper</emph> is especially intended for the Family
               Circle, the utmost care will be taken to preserve, throughout, a strictly Moral Tone,
               and with this view, <emph rend="ital">all advertisements of an objectionable
                  character will be carefully excluded</emph>. The proceedings of the Law and Police
               Courts will be fully reported, and no pains will be spared to obtain the best and
               latest Foreign, Town, and Country News, with Accurate Accounts of Public Meetings,
               Lectures, Exhibitions, &amp;c. Carefully digested Reports of the Parliamentary
               Proceedings and Debates will also be given. Due attention will be paid to the
               Markets, Funds, Railways, Sporting Intelligence, &amp;c.<lb/> We intend making the
               Reviews of New Books, Science, Archaeology, the Fine Arts, Music, the Theatres,
               &amp;c., especial features: this portion will be confided to gentlemen distinguised
               by their attainments in the Arts, Science, and Literature.<lb/>
               <emph rend="ac">A Principal Novelty</emph> in this Paper, distinguishing it from all
               others, will be the devotion, from week to week, of a portion of its Columns <emph
                  rend="ital">to the <emph rend="ac">History of the Origin</emph> of contemporary
                  events, with Biographical notices of persons lately sprung into notoriety</emph>.
               Thus, we shall not think it enough to record a passing occurrence, but when it
               possesses anny importance, make it a portion of our duty to give the particular of
               such event, and the <emph rend="ital">cause</emph> which led to it. It has been a
               matter of complaint, that, in the newspapers generally, great political incidents as
               they occur are brought <emph rend="ital">abruptly</emph> before the public, without
               that sort of information relating to their <emph rend="ital">antecedents</emph> which
               would make them intelligible to the general reader; this defect we hope to
               remedy.<lb/> But, while we devote a portion of our space to all these subjects, the
               Political Department of our Paper will be earnestly conducted, nor shall we shrink,
               in the slightest degree, from the responsibility attached to it. We will honestly
               advocate the great cause of National Progress, and we need scarcely add the
               continuance of the free and enlightened Commercial Policy which has so largely
               contributed to the present material comforts of the humbler classes, and thus to the
               general prosperity of the country: while we no less firmly support, on the other
               hand, the interests of Social Order against Mob Despotism, and the great principles
               of Constitutional Liberty against Individual or Combined Oppression.<lb/> With regard
               to the Church, we profess ourselves Staunch Protestants, but we shall advocate the
               cause of Religious Liberty, and do all in our power to promote Reform of Abuses which
               have crept into Ecclesiastical Establishments. In short, we shall suport deliberate
               and well-conducted Reform wherever it is required, in Church or in State, in Law, or
               other Learned Professions, in Corporate Bodies and Institutions, in the Commerical
               and Colonial Relations of the Kingdom, in Education, and in everyhthing which regards
               the Social Condition and Social Comforts of our Countrymen. It is for them that our
                  <emph rend="sc">Paper</emph> is designed; we shall espouse the cause of no sect or
               party; but, whatever set of men may be in power, we shall judge every Measure of
               Government only by its intrinsic merits and the benefits it is likely to secure for
               the country.<lb/> An Edition will be published on Friday, in time for the Evening
               Mails for the country, and the last Edition on Saturday evening at Six o'clock, which
               will contain the latest general news, the market and commercial intelligence, with
               quotations of prices corrected to the hour of going to press.<lb/> Orders will be
               attended to by all News-vendors throughout the United Kingdom; or the Publisher will
               send it directly from the office upon the receipt of a Quarter's Subscription, <emph

            <note xml:id="n1">Dickens is not the first author to publish a serialized form of the
               novel, this is attributed to an author known only as <hi rend="italics">Boz</hi>
               through the publishing company Chapman and Hall. Boz's work, popularly known back
               then as the <hi rend="italics">Pickwick Papers</hi>, were selling as much as 40,000
               copies per month in 1836. Nevertheless, Dickens is considered as the first already
               commercially successful author, as he already finished his 8th novel -- <hi

            <note xml:id="n2">Although this appears to be a letter to Charles Dickens, it is an
               adevertisement, nonetheless. In this sort of letter, the company thanked Dickens for
               his work on Bleak House and also mentioned his other popular work such as <hi
                  rend="italics">David Copperfield</hi>, to perhaps show sincerity, and then went on
               to promote and rave about their products. This strategy of connecting the
               advertisement to the source material, either to Bleak House or to Charles Dickens
               himself, is seen in other ads of those days. See for example <ref type="biblio"
