            <p>Bleak House itself is a fiction about the lives of the rich and poor in London society during the Victorian era. However, our main focus is on the advertisements appearing before and after the serialized novel. These advertisements are appealing to a certain group of consumers during the mid-Victorian era of London. From our edition, readers would be able to peek into the world of 1852 when Bleak House was being published as a serial. The advertisements present in Bleak House are an artifact of that time; though they were likely ignored during it, they now provide a unique window into that time period. The audience for this edition would likely be people researching this time period rather than people who want to read Bleak House as a text; this means that it would lend itself moreso to scholars rather than laypeople.</p>
