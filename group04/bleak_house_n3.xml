            <p>Bleak House itself is a fiction about the lives of the rich and poor in London society during the Victorian era. However, our main focus is on the advertisements appearing before and after the serialized novel. These advertisements are appealing to a certain group of consumers during the mid-Victorian era of London. From our edition, readers would be able to peek into the world of 1852 when Bleak House was
being published as a serial. The advertisements present in Bleak House are an artifact of that time; though they were likely ignored during it, they now provide a unique window into that time period. The audience for this edition would likely be people researching this time period rather than people who want to read Bleak House as a text; this means that it would lend itself moreso to scholars rather than laypeople.</p>

            <p>
               This edition focuses on the advertisements that appeared alongside the original <ref type="note" target="#n1">serialized publication</ref> of Bleak House written by Charles Dickens and illustrated by Hablot Knight Browne. This first edition was published in monthly parts between 1852 and 1853 and a well preserved complete set is available at the Special Collections of the University of Washington Libraries. While the novel itself has been widely studied for its plot, characters, and social commentary, the ads printed in each issue are often overlooked. These advertisements offer a lot of information about what people were buying, what they cared about, and how products and services were marketed to them. From cures for illnesses to new inventions and fashion trends, the ads show what everyday life might have looked like for mid-Victorian era of London.
            </p>
            <p>
               Our approach treats each advertisement as a single unit of analysis, carefully examining its components such as images, product descriptions, catalogs, testimonials, and more. What remedies for ailments were marketed to the public 150 years ago? Do they resemble the products sold to us today? How about their fashion, do some of those trends still exists today? What can these advertisements reveal about Victorian-era society, and how might those insights still resonate with our present-day culture? These are the questions we found compelling, and we hope you, as the reader, will find them just as intriguing.
            </p>
            <p>
               In creating this edition, our team chose to present a diplomatic transcription to preserve the original appearance and appeal of these advertisements as they were seen by the public. We maintained the original language and the layout of images alongside the text. In cases where words were hyphenated due to space constraints in the original print, we have standardized them into single words for clarity. We've also
highlighted distinctive elements within the advertisements that we believe offer valuable opportunities for further analysis of print media from that era. We hope you enjoy this unique edition of Bleak House.

            <p><ref type="note" target="#n2">We thank you for your new work</ref>. Though its name
               is <q rend="ac">Bleak House,</q>we know well that its inmates will be warm and
               life-like. We thank you for it, not only for the pleasure that we, in common with all
               its other readers, shall receive in its perusal, but we thank you on more solid
               grounds; ,ve thank you for it as a matter of business.</p>
            <p>If it be true, that an observer must know of the existence of a place before he can
               arrange for visiting it, it must be equally true, that the public must be aware of
               the existence of an establishment before they can contemplate patronising it; and
               further, that they must be aware of the advantages offered by a particular concern
               before they will select that in preference to any other. On these grounds, then, we
               thank you for <q rend="ac">Bleak House</q> in a business point of view, because it
               affords us an opportunity of conveying to all its readers the advantages or our
               Establishment, and the principles upon which it continues to be conducted.</p>
            <p>Many thousands of readers have, we doubt not, entered upon their tasks since even <q rend="ac"><name type="person">David Copperfield</name></q> monthly appeared,
               between his <q>green leaves,</q> and some of these readers may note with favour the
               statement we here subjoin.</p>
            <p><q>We keep for the selection of purchaser all kinds or Tea and Coffee fit for use
                  imported into this country, and we supply them at the most moderate cost at which
                  they can possibly be sold.</q></p>
            <p><q>We have endeavoured to render ourselves particularly celebrated for supplying Teas
                  of the most sound and excellent qualities.</q></p>
            <p><q>We have a Patented Invention for Roasting Coffee, Cocoa, &amp;c. in Silver. By
                  this plan the ordinary evils of roasting such produce in a cylinder made of base
                  metal are avoided, whilst the cost of the produce is not increased.</q></p>
            <p><q>We deliver by our Vans all Orders from any part of the <name type="place">Metropolitan Districts</name>, within eight miles of <name type="place">St.
                     Paul's</name>, on tho day after such orders are given.</q></p>
            <p><q>We also send into the Country, free of carriage, all Orders, if they be
                  accompanied by a remittance for payment, whether by half-notes, Post Office Order,
                  or otherwise, provided the goods ordered amount to £2 or upwards.</q></p>
            <p><q>We sell our goods only for immediate payment. Our tariff of profit is fixed
                  without allowing for the interest on capital necessary to support a heavy amount
                  of debts.</q></p>
            <p>For the facilities that this excellent medium of publicity has allowed us for making
               known the above particulars, we sincerely thank you, and we trust and hope that by
               our care and attention, and by the excellence of the Goods we supply, those readers
               of <q rend="ac">Bleak House</q> who may turn their favourable patronage to <q>Number
                  One</q>, will never regret having glanced over the first page of its white paper,

               Indigestion is a weakness or want of power of the digestive juices in the stomach to convert what we eat and drink into healthy matter, for the proper nourishment of the whole system. It is caused by every thing which weakens the system in general, or the stomach in particular. From it proceed nearly all diseases to which we are liable; for it is very certain, that if we could always keep the stomach right we should only die by old age or accident. Indigestion produces a great variety of unpleasant sensations: amongst the prominent of its miserable effects are a want of, or an inordinate, appetite, sometimes attended with a constant craving for drink, a distension or feeling enlargement of the stomach, flatulency, heartburn, pains in the stomach, acidity, unpleasant taste in the mouth, perhaps sickness, rumbling noise in the bowels: in some cases of depraved digestions there is nearly a complete disrelish for food, but still the appetite is not greatly impaired, as at the stated period of meals persons so afflicted can eat heartily, although without much gratification; a long train of nervous symptoms are also frequent attendants, general debility, great languidess, and incapacity for exertion. The minds of persons so afflicted frequently become irraitable and desponding, and great anxiety is observable in the countenance; they appear thoughtful, melancholy, and dejected, under great apprehension of some imaginary danger, will start at any unexpected noise or occurrence, and become so agitated that they require some time to calm and collect themselves; yet for all this the mind is exhilarated without much difficulty; pleasing events, society, will for a time dissipate all appearance of disease; but the excitement produced by an agreeable change vanishes soon after the cause has gone by. Other symptoms are, voilent palpitations, restlessness, the sleep disturbed by frightful dreams and startings, and affording little or no refreshment: occasionally there is much moaning, with a sense of weight and oppression upon the chest, nightmare, &amp;c.<lb/>  
               It is almost impossible to enumerate all the symptoms of this first invader upon the constitution, as in a hundred cases of <emph rend="ital">Indigestion</emph> there will probably be something peculiar to each; but, be they what they may, they are all occassioned by the food becoming a burden rather than a support to the stomach; and in all its stages the medicine most wanted is that which will afford speedy and effectual assistance to the digestive organs, and give energy to the nervous and muscular systems,-nothing can more speedily or with more certainty effect so desirable an object than <emph rend="ital">Norton's Extract of Camomile Flowers</emph>. The herb has from time immemorial been highly esteemed in England as a grateful anodyne, imparting an aromatic bitter to the taste, and a pleasing degree of warmth and strength to the stomach; and in all cases of indigestion, gout in the stomach, windy colic, and general weakness, it has for ages been strongly recommended by the most eminent practitioners as very useful and beneficial. The great, indeed only, objection to its use has been the large quantity of water which it takes to dissolve a small part of the flowers and which must be taken with it into the<pb n="59"/><fw type="page_number" place="top_right">2</fw> stomach. It requires a quarter of a pint of boiling water to dissolve the soluble portion of one drachm of camomile flowers; and, when one or even two ounces may be taken with advantage, it must at once be seen how impossible it is to take a proper dose of this wholesome herb in the form of tea; and the only reason why it has not long since been placed the very first in rank of all restorative medicines is that in taking it the stomach has always been loaded with water which tends in a great measure to counteract, and very frequently wholly to destroy the effect. It must be evident that loading a weak stomach with a large purpose of conveying into it a small
quantity of medicine must be injurious; and that the medicines must possess powerful renovating properties only to counteract the bad effects likely to be produced by the water. Generally speaking, this has been the case with camomile flowers, a herb possessing the highest restorative qualities, and when properly taken, decidedly the most speedy restorer, and the most certain preserver of health.<lb/>
               These <emph rend="sc"> pills</emph> are wholly <emph rend="sc">camomile</emph>, prepared by a peculiar process, accidentally discovered, and known only to the proprietor, and which he firmly believes to be one of the most valuable modern discoveries in medicine, by which all the essential and extractice matter of more than an ounce of the flowers is concentrated in four moderate-sized pills. Experience has afforded the most ample proof that they possess all the fine aromatic and stomachic properties for which the herb has been esteemed; and, as they are taken into the stomach unencumbered by any diluting or indigestible substance, in the same degree has their enefit been more immediate and decided. Mild in their operation and pleasant in their effect, they may be taken at any age, and under any circumstance, without danger or inconvenience. A person exposed to cold and wet a whole day or night could not possibly receive any injury from taking them, but, on the contrary, they would effectually prevent a cold being taken. After a long acquaintance with and strict observance of the medicinal properties of <emph rend="ital">Norton's Camomile Pills</emph>, it is only doing them justice to say, that they are really the most valuable of all <emph rend="sc">tonic medicines</emph>. By the word tonic is meant a medicine which gives strength to the stomach sufficient to digest in proper quantities all wholesome food, which increases the power of every nerve and muscle of the human body, or, in other words, invigorates the nervous and muscular systems. The solidity or firmness of the whole tissue of the body which so quickly follows the use of <emph rend="ital">Norton's Camomile Pills</emph>, their certain and speedy effects in repairing the partial dilapidations from time or intemperance, and their lasting salutary in fluence on the whole frame, is most con vincing, that in the smallest compass is contained the largest quantity of the tonic principle, of so peculiar a nature as to pervade the whole system, through which it diffuses health and strength sufficient to resist the formation of disease, and also to fortify the consitution against contagion; as such, their general use is strongly recommended as a
preventative during the prevalence of malignant fever or other infectious diseases, and to persons attending sick rooms they are invaluable as in no one instance have they ever failed in preventing the taking of illness, even under the most trying circumstances.<lb/>
               As <emph rend="ital"> Norton's Camomile Pills</emph> are particularly recommended for all stomach complaints or indigestion, it will probably be expected that some advice should be given respecting diet, though after all that has been written upon the subject, after the publication of volume upon volume, after the country has, as it were, been inundated with practical essays on diet, as a means of prolonging life, it would be unnecessary to say more, did we not feel it our duty to make the humble endeavor of inducing the public to regard them not, but to adopt that course which is dictated by nature, by reason, and common sense. Those persons who study the wholesomes, and are governed by the opinions of writers on diet, are uniformly both unhealthy in body and weak in mind. There can be no doubt that the palate is designed to inform us what is proper for the stomach, and of course that must best instruct us what food to take and what to avoid: we want no other adviser. Nothing can be more clear than that those articles which are agreeable to the taste were by nature intended for our food and sustenance, whether liquid or solid, foreign or of native production: if they are pure and unadulterated, no harm need be dreaded by their<pb n="60"/><fw type="page_number" place="top_right">3</fw> use; they will only injure by abuse. Consequently, whatever the palate approves, eat and drink always in moderation, but never in excess; keeping in mind that the first process of digestion is performed in the mouth, the second in the stomach; and that, in order that the stomach may be able to do its work properly, it is requisite the first should be well performed; this consists in masticating or chewing the solid food, so as to break down and separate the fibres and small substances of meat and vegetables,
mixing them well, and blending the whole together before they are swallowed; and it is particularly urged upon all to take plenty of time to their meals and never eat in haste. If you conform to this short and simple, but comprehensive advice, and find that there are various things which others eat and drink with pleasure and without inconvenience, and which would be pleasant to yourself only that they disagree, you may at once conclude that the fault is in the stomach, that it does not possess the power which it ought to do, that it wants assistance, and the sooner that assistance is afforded the better. A very short trial of this medicine will best prove how soon it will put the stomach in a condition to perform with ease all the work which nature intended for it. By its use you will soon be able to enjoy, in moderation, whatever
is agreeable to the taste, and unable to name one individual article of food which disagrees with or sits unpleasantly on the stomach. Never forget that a small meal well digested affords more nourishment to the system than a large one, even of the same food, when digested imperfectly. Let the dish be ever so delicious, ever so enticing a variety offered, the bottle ever so enchanting, never forget that temperance tends to preserve health, and that health is the soul of enjoyment. But should an impropriety be at any time, or ever so often, committed, by which the stomach becomes overloaded or disordered, render it immediate aid by taking a dose of <emph rend="ital">Norton's Camomile Pills</emph>, which will so promtly assist in carrying off the burden thus imposed upon it that all will soon be right again.<lb/>
               It is most certainly true that every person in his lifetime consumes a quantity of noxious matter, which if taken at one meal would be fatal; it is these small quantities of noxious matter, which are introduced into our food, either by accident or wilful adulteration, which we find so often upset the stomach, and not unfrequently lay the foundation of illness, and perhaps final ruination to health. To preserve the constitution, it should be our constant care, if possible, to counteract the effect of these small quantities of unwholesome matter; and whenever, in that way, an enemy to the consitution finds its way into the stomach, a friend should be immediately sent after it, which would prevent its mischievous effects, and expel it altogether; no better friend can be found, nor one which will perform the task with
greater certainty, than <emph rend="sc">norton's camomile pills</emph>. And let it be observed that the longer this medicine is taken the less it will be wanted; it can in no case become habitual, as its entire action is to give energy and force to the stomach, which is the spring of life, the source from which the whole frame draws its succour and support. After an excess of eating or drinking, and upon every occasion
of the general health being at all disturbed, these <emph rend="sc">pills</emph> should be immediately taken, as they will stop and eradicate disease at its commencement. Indeed it is most confidently asserted, that by the timely use of this medicine only, and a common degree of caution, any person may enjoy all the comforts within his reach, may pass through life without an illness, and with the certainty of attaining a healthy <emph rend="sc">old age</emph>.<lb/>

               <emph rend="medFont ac">To the Middle Classes.</emph><lb/>
               In offering the <emph
rend="sc">London Weekly Paper</emph> to represent you in that great and still growing power, the Parliament of the British Press, we are aware that, previous to giving us your sufferages, you will demand--and justly--a full, clear, and candid statement of the part we propose to act on this great stage of Social and Political Life. With candour then we say, if we are returned, (and as those Members of Parliament who represent the larger constituencies are those whose opinions are attached the greater weight, so the greater number of votes you register in <pb
n="67"/>our favor the greater will be our influence, and consequently our sphere of usefulness,) that it is our purpose to enforce two high principles: I. Social Improvement; II. Political Reform.<lb/>
               With our Social Duties then we will commence. We desire to supply a want long felt by a large portion of the Public: -- <emph rend="ital">viz</emph>, a <emph rend="sc">Weekly Paper</emph> that shall at once embrace all the <emph rend="ital">news and topics of the week</emph>, and, at the same time, maintain a <emph rend="ital">higher literary character</emph> than has generally been assumed by the weekly press. It will be of the full size, consisting of sixty-four columns, printed on superior paper, from bold, clear type.<lb/>
               As our <emph rend="sc">London Weekly Paper</emph> is especially intended for the Family Circle, the utmost care will be taken to preserve, throughout, a strictly Moral Tone, and with this view, <emph rend="ital">all advertisements of an objectionable
character will be carefully excluded</emph>. The proceedings of the Law and Police Courts will be fully reported, and no pains will be spared to obtain the best and latest Foreign, Town, and Country News, with Accurate Accounts of Public Meetings, Lectures, Exhibitions, &amp;c. Carefully digested Reports of the Parliamentary Proceedings and Debates will also be given. Due attention will be paid to the Markets, Funds, Railways, Sporting Intelligence, &amp;c.<lb/>
               We intend making the Reviews of New Books, Science, Archaeology, the Fine Arts, Music, the Theatres, &amp;c., especial features: this portion will be confided to gentlemen distinguised by their attainments in the Arts, Science, and Literature.<lb/>
<emph rend="ac">A Principal Novelty</emph> in this Paper, distinguishing it from all others, will be the devotion, from week to week, of a portion of its Columns <emph rend="ital">to the <emph rend="ac">History of the Origin</emph> of contemporary events, with Biographical notices of persons lately sprung into notoriety</emph>. Thus, we shall not think it enough to record a passing occurrence, but when it possesses anny importance, make it a portion of our duty to give the particular of such event, and the <emph rend="ital">cause</emph> which led to it. It has been a matter of complaint, that, in the newspapers generally, great political incidents as they occur are brought <emph rend="ital">abruptly</emph> before the public, without that sort of information relating to their <emph rend="ital">antecedents</emph> which would make them intelligible to the general reader; this defect we hope to remedy.<lb/>
               But, while we devote a portion of our space to all these subjects, the Political Department of our Paper will be earnestly conducted, nor shall we shrink, in the slightest degree, from the responsibility attached to it. We will honestly advocate the great cause of National Progress, and we need scarcely add the continuance of the free and enlightened Commercial Policy which has so largely contributed to the present material comforts of the humbler classes, and thus to the general prosperity of the country: while we no less firmly support, on the other hand, the interests of Social Order against Mob Despotism, and the great principles of Constitutional Liberty against Individual or Combined Oppression.<lb/>
               With regard to the Church, we profess ourselves Staunch Protestants, but we shall advocate the cause of Religious Liberty, and do all in our power to promote Reform of Abuses which have crept into Ecclesiastical Establishments. In short, we shall suport deliberate and well-conducted Reform wherever it is required, in Church or in State, in Law, or other Learned Professions, in Corporate Bodies and Institutions, in the Commerical and Colonial Relations of the Kingdom, in Education, and in everyhthing which regards the Social Condition and Social Comforts of our Countrymen. It is for them that our <emph rend="sc">Paper</emph> is designed; we shall espouse the cause of no sect or party; but, whatever set of men may be in power, we shall judge every Measure of Government only by its intrinsic merits and the benefits it is likely to secure for the country.<lb/>
               An Edition will be published on Friday, in time for the Evening Mails for the country, and the last Edition on Saturday evening at Six o'clock, which will contain the latest general news, the market and commercial intelligence, with quotations of prices corrected to the hour of going to press.<lb/>
               Orders will be attended to by all News-vendors throughout the United Kingdom; or the Publisher will send it directly from the office upon the receipt of a Quarter's Subscription, <emph rend="ital">viz</emph>., 4s. 4d.<lb/>

               through the publishing company Chapman and Hall. Boz's work, popularly known back
               then as the <hi rend="italics">Pickwick Papers</hi>, were selling as much as 40,000
               copies per month in 1836. Nevertheless, Dickens is considered as the first already

               to promote and rave about their products. This strategy of connecting the
               advertisement to the source material, either to Bleak House or to Charles Dickens
               himself, is seen in other ads of those days. See for example <ref type="biblio" target="li2018">Li, 2018</ref>.</note>
