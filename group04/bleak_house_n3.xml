            <p>Bleak House itself is a fiction about the lives of the rich and poor in London
               society during the Victorian era. However, our main focus is on the advertisements
               appearing before and after the serialized novel. These advertisements are appealing
               to a certain group of consumers during the mid-Victorian era of London. From our
               edition, readers would be able to peek into the world of 1852 when Bleak House was
               being published as a serial. The advertisements present in Bleak House are an
               artifact of that time; though they were likely ignored during it, they now provide a
               unique window into that time period. The audience for this edition would likely be
               people researching this time period rather than people who want to read Bleak House
               as a text; this means that it would lend itself moreso to scholars rather than
               laypeople.</p>
