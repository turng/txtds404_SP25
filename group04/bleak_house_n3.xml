            <p>Bleak House itself is a fiction about the lives of the rich and poor in London society during the Victorian era. However, our main focus is on the advertisements appearing before and after the serialized novel. These advertisements are appealing to a certain group of consumers during the mid-Victorian era of London. From our edition, readers would be able to peek into the world of 1852 when Bleak House was being published as a serial. The advertisements present in Bleak House are an artifact of that time; though they were likely ignored during it, they now provide a unique window into that time period. The audience for this edition would likely be people researching this time period rather than people who want to read Bleak House as a text; this means that it would lend itself moreso to scholars rather than laypeople.</p>

system.</emph><lb/>Indigestion is a weakness or want of power of the digestive
juices in the stomach to convert what we eat and drink into healthy matter, for the
proper nourishment of the whole system. It is caused by every thing which weakens the
system in general, or the stomach in particular. From it proceed nearly all diseases
to which we are liable; for it is very certain, that if we could always keep the
stomach right we should only die by old age or accident. Indigestion produces a great
variety of unpleasant sensations: amongst the prominent of its miserable effects are
a want of, or an inordinate, appetite, sometimes attended with a constant craving for
drink, a distension or feeling enlargement of the stomach, flatulency, heartburn,
pains in the stomach, acidity, unpleasant taste in the mouth, perhaps sickness,
rumbling noise in the bowels: in some cases of depraved digestions there is nearly a
complete disrelish for food, but still the appetite is not greatly impaired, as at
the stated period of meals persons so afflicted can eat heartily, although without
much gratification; a long train of nervous symptoms are also frequent attendants,
general debility, great languidess, and incapacity for exertion. The minds of persons
so afflicted frequently become irraitable and desponding, and great anxiety is
observable in the countenance; they appear thoughtful, melancholy, and dejected,
under great apprehension of some imaginary danger, will start at any unexpected noise
or occurrence, and become so agitated that they require some time to calm and collect
themselves; yet for all this the mind is exhilarated without much difficulty;
pleasing events, society, will for a time dissipate all appearance of disease; but
the excitement produced by an agreeable change vanishes soon after the cause has gone
by. Other symptoms are, voilent palpitations, restlessness, the sleep disturbed by
frightful dreams and startings, and affording little or no refreshment: occasionally
there is much moaning, with a sense of weight and oppression upon the chest,
nightmare, &amp;c.<lb/>It is almost impossible to enumerate all the symptoms of this
first invader upon the constitution, as in a hundred cases of <emph rend="ital">Indigestion</emph> there will probably be something peculiar to each; but, be they what they may, they are all occassioned by the food becoming a burden rather
than a support to the stomach; and in all its stages the medicine most wanted is that
which will afford speedy and effectual assistance to the digestive organs, and give
energy to the nervous and muscular systems,-nothing can more speedily or with more
certainty effect so desirable an object than <emph rend="ital">Norton's Extract of Camomile Flowers</emph>. The herb has from time immemorial been highly esteemed in England as a grateful anodyne, imparting an aromatic bitter to the taste, and a pleasing degree of warmth and strength to the stomach; and in all cases of indigestion, gout in the stomach, windy colic, and general weakness, it has for ages been strongly recommended by the most eminent practitioners as very useful and
beneficial. The great, indeed only, objection to its use has been the large quantity
of water which it takes to dissolve a small part of the flowers and which must be
taken with it into the<pb n="59"/><fw type="page_number" place="top_right">2</fw>
stomach. It requires a quarter of a pint of boiling water to dissolve the soluble
portion of one drachm of camomile flowers; and, when one or even two ounces may be
taken with advantage, it must at once be seen how impossible it is to take a proper
dose of this wholesome herb in the form of tea; and the only reason why it has not
long since been placed the very first in rank of all restorative medicines is that in
taking it the stomach has always been loaded with water which tends in a great
measure to counteract, and very frequently wholly to destroy the effect. It must be
evident that loading a weak stomach with a large purpose of conveying into it a small
quantity of medicine must be injurious; and that the medicines must possess powerful
renovating properties only to counteract the bad effects likely to be produced by the
water. Generally speaking, this has been the case with camomile flowers, a herb
possessing the highest restorative qualities, and when properly taken, decidedly the
most speedy restorer, and the most certain preserver of health.<lb/>These <emph rend="sc">
pills</emph> are wholly <emph rend="sc">camomile</emph>, prepared by a peculiar
process, accidentally discovered, and known only to the proprietor, and which he
firmly believes to be one of the most valuable modern discoveries in medicine, by
which all the essential and extractice matter of more than an ounce of the flowers is
concentrated in four moderate-sized pills. Experience has afforded the most ample
proof that they possess all the fine aromatic and stomachic properties for which the
herb has been esteemed; and, as they are taken into the stomach unencumbered by any
diluting or indigestible substance, in the same degree has their benefit been more
immediate and decided. Mild in their operation and pleasant in their effect, they may
be taken at any age, and under any circumstance, without danger or inconvenience. A
person exposed to cold and wet a whole day or night could not possibly receive any
injury from taking them, but, on the contrary, they would effectually prevent a cold
being taken. After a long acquaintance with and strict observance of the medicinal
properties of <emph rend="ital">Norton's Camomile Pills</emph>, it is only doing them
justice to say, that they are really the most valuable of all <emph rend="sc">tonic
medicines</emph>. By the word tonic is meant a medicine which gives strength to
the stomach sufficient to digest in proper quantities all wholesome food, which
increases the power of every nerve and muscle of the human body, or, in other words,
invigorates the nervous and muscular systems. The solidity or firmness of the whole
tissue of the body which so quickly follows the use of <emph rend="ital">Norton's
Camomile Pills</emph>, their certain and speedy effects in repairing the partial
dilapidations from time or intemperance, and their lasting salutary in fluence on the
whole frame, is most con vincing, that in the smallest compass is contained the
largest quantity of the tonic principle, of so peculiar a nature as to pervade the
whole system, through which it diffuses health and strength sufficient to resist the
formation of disease, and also to fortify the consitution against contagion; as such,
their general use is strongly recommended as a preventative during the prevalence of
malignant fever or other infectious diseases, and to persons attending sick rooms
they are invaluable as in no one instance have they ever failed in preventing the
taking of illness, even under the most trying circumstances.<lb/> As <emph rend="ital">
Norton's Camomile Pills</emph> are particularly recommended for all stomach
complaints or indigestion, it will probably be expected that some advice should be
given respecting diet, though after all that has been written upon the subject, after
the publication of volume upon volume, after the country has, as it were, been
inundated with practical essays on diet, as a means of prolonging life, it would be
unnecessary to say more, did we not feel it our duty to make the humble endeavor of
inducing the public to regard them not, but to adopt that course which is dictated by
nature, by reason, and common sense. Those persons who study the wholesomes, and are
governed by the opinions of writers on diet, are uniformly both unhealthy in body and
weak in mind. There can be no doubt that the palate is designed to inform us what is
proper for the stomach, and of course that must best instruct us what food to take
and what to avoid: we want no other adviser. Nothing can be more clear than that
those articles which are agreeable to the taste were by nature intended for our food
and sustenance, whether liquid or solid, foreign or of native production: if they are
pure and unadulterated, no harm need be dreaded by their<pb n="60"/><fw
type="page_number" place="top_right">3</fw> use; they will only injure by abuse.
Consequently, whatever the palate approves, eat and drink always in moderation, but
never in excess; keeping in mind that the first process of digestion is performed in
the mouth, the second in the stomach; and that, in order that the stomach may be able
to do its work properly, it is requisite the first should be well performed; this
consists in masticating or chewing the solid food, so as to break down and separate
the fibres and small substances of meat and vegetables, mixing them well, and
blending the whole together before they are swallowed; and it is particularly urged
upon all to take plenty of time to their meals and never eat in haste. If you conform
to this short and simple, but comprehensive advice, and find that there are various
things which others eat and drink with pleasure and without inconvenience, and which
would be pleasant to yourself only that they disagree, you may at once conclude that
the fault is in the stomach, that it does not possess the power which it ought to do,
that it wants assistance, and the sooner that assistance is afforded the better. A
very short trial of this medicine will best prove how soon it will put the stomach in
a condition to perform with ease all the work which nature intended for it. By its
use you will soon be able to enjoy, in moderation, whatever is agreeable to the
taste, and unable to name one individual article of food which disagrees with or sits
unpleasantly on the stomach. Never forget that a small meal well digested affords
more nourishment to the system than a large one, even of the same food, when digested
imperfectly. Let the dish be ever so delicious, ever so enticing a variety offered,
the bottle ever so enchanting, never forget that temperance tends to preserve health,
and that health is the soul of enjoyment. But should an impropriety be at any time,
or ever so often, committed, by which the stomach becomes overloaded or disordered,
render it immediate aid by taking a dose of <emph rend="ital">Norton's Camomile
Pills</emph>, which will so promtly assist in carrying off the burden thus imposed
upon it that all will soon be right again.<lb/>It is most certainly true that every
person in his lifetime consumes a quantity of noxious matter, which if taken at one
meal would be fatal; it is these small quantities of noxious matter, which are
introduced into our food, either by accident or wilful adulteration, which we find so
often upset the stomach, and not unfrequently lay the foundation of illness, and
perhaps final ruination to health. To preserve the constitution, it should be our
constant care, if possible, to counteract the effect of these small quantities of
unwholesome matter; and whenever, in that way, an enemy to the consitution finds its
way into the stomach, a friend should be immediately sent after it, which would
prevent its mischievous effects, and expel it altogether; no better friend can be
found, nor one which will perform the task with greater certainty, than <emph
rend="sc">norton's camomile pills</emph>. And let it be observed that the longer
this medicine is taken the less it will be wanted; it can in no case become habitual,
as its entire action is to give energy and force to the stomach, which is the spring
of life, the source from which the whole frame draws its succour and support. After
an excess of eating or drinking, and upon every occasion of the general health being
at all disturbed, these <emph rend="sc">pills</emph> should be immediately taken, as
they will stop and eradicate disease at its commencement. Indeed it is most
confidently asserted, that by the timely use of this medicine only, and a common
degree of caution, any person may enjoy all the comforts within his reach, may pass
through life without an illness, and with the certainty of attaining a healthy <emph
rend="sc">old age</emph>.<lb/> On account of their volatile properties, they must be
kept in bottles; and if closely corked their qualities are neither impaired by time
nor injured by any change of climate whatever. Price 13 1/2 d. and 2s.9d.each, with
full directions. The large bottle contains the quantity of three small ones, or <emph
