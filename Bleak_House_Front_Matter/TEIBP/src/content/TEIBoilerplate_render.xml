               a digital publication of the advertisements themselves as the lead into the first few

         <div type="editorial_intro">
            <p>Bleak House is a novel written by Charles Dickens, originally published in serial
               format over the course of 20 chapters–in 19 installments–between the years of 1852
               and 1853. While the compiled novel itself is among Dickens’ many acclaimed writings,
               the serialized installments offer material that is omitted from the published novel
               format, namely in terms of the front matter used to display various advertisements
               authentic to the date of publication.</p>
            <p>This edition, in addressing the above, is focused not on Bleak House as a novel, and
               instead dedicated to the preservation of the front matter and the formatting of the
               advertisements contained within for the sake of offering an accurate glimpse into the
               various goods and services being offered to the public in the early 1850s. In
               addition, the preservation of the formatting of each advertisement, though altered
               slightly to adhere to a more uniform font code, will preserve the changes in font
               size, bold, and italicization to further provide as authentic of a digitization as
               possible.</p>
            <p>One editorial decision we will be strictly adhering to is the presentation of the
               text itself as it was written. Being a relatively recent text, we see no reason to
               alter the verbiage from how it was originally published, as adapting the speech for a
               modern audience would detract from the contextualization we aim to present with this
               document. Additionally, we will include the illustrations both as textual
               descriptions and as image files archived online to fully present each advertisement
               as it was originally published.</p>

            <note xml:id="n1">Charles Dickens was well-acquainted with the serialized form, as not
               only a novelist himself but also an editor.<ref type="biblio" target="#source1">See
                  source 1</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="n2">In this advertisement, on the inside of the front cover itself, the
               long s is used despite the character having already been out of use. As it was
               archaic at the time, and therefore likely chosen for stylistic reasons, we have
               retained it here.</note>
            <note xml:id="n3">Dr. John Lindley, mentioned across multiple ads contained within
               Dickens’ Bleak House front matter, was a botanist from the University of England.
               During his time at the University of England, he was actually the first professor of
               botany to work at the University; spending his time working on articles and
               editorials on botany for other academics. Amidst this, as it appears through the
               Bleak House front matter he would also spend time writing articles on more common
               houseplants and widespread information that would cater to wider audiences; further
               fueling his renown and commonplace within Bleak House ads. <ref type="biblio"
