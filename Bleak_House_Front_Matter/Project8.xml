               the front matter of this text, as it is a major element of context of the original
               reading that is absent in many modern editions. This edition considers how to create
               a digital publication of the advertisements themselves as the lead into the first few

         <div type="editorial_intro">
            <p>Bleak House is a novel written by Charles Dickens, originally published in serial
               format over the course of 20 chapters–in 19 installments–between the years of 1852
               and 1853. While the compiled novel itself is among Dickens’ many acclaimed writings,
               the serialized installments offer material that is omitted from the published novel
               format, namely in terms of the front matter used to display various advertisements
               authentic to the date of publication.</p>
            <p>This edition, in addressing the above, is focused not on Bleak House as a novel, and
               instead dedicated to the preservation of the front matter and the formatting of the
               advertisements contained within for the sake of offering an accurate glimpse into the
               various goods and services being offered to the public in the early 1850s. In
               addition, the preservation of the formatting of each advertisement, though altered
               slightly to adhere to a more uniform font code, will preserve the changes in font
               size, bold, and italicization to further provide as authentic of a digitization as
               possible.</p>
            <p>One editorial decision we will be strictly adhering to is the presentation of the
               text itself as it was written. Being a relatively recent text, we see no reason to
               alter the verbiage from how it was originally published, as adapting the speech for a
               modern audience would detract from the contextualization we aim to present with this
               document. Additionally, we will include the illustrations both as textual
               descriptions and as image files archived online to fully present each advertisement
               as it was originally published.</p>

               in CURING a SORE LEG.--<persName>John Thomas</persName>, a labourer, far advanced in years, residing at 
               <placeName>Pemaen Back</placeName>, near <placeName>Conway</placeName>, had suffered for a very considerable time from a dreadfully 
               sore leg, and was for many months under the care of most eminent medical men, but their remedies appeared perfectly useless. 
               He then commenced using Holloway's Ointment and Pills, and after giving them a fair trial, his leg was completely cured, and the 
               wounds soundly healed. These medicines excel all others in the cure of scrofula or king's evil, glandular and other unnatural 
               swellings, scurvy, leprosy, and all diseases of the skin.--Sold by all Druggists, and at

               Goldsmiths, Established A.D. 1798, began to announce to the Nobility, Gentry, and Public in general, that in obedience to 
               the numerous calls made upon them since the Great Exhibition, they have resolved to throw open their Manufactory to the 
               public at <hi rend="italic">Manufacturers' Prices</hi>, a closer connexion than has hitherto existed between the real worker 
               in the precious metals and the Public, being obviously an advantage to both parties.</p>
            <p><orgName key="Watherston &amp; Brogden">WATHERSTON &amp; BROGDEN</orgName>'S dealings will be principally to establish 
               confidence in the gold employed in the manufacture of chains, where at present the greatest uncertainty exists, owing to 
               the prevalence of electro-gilt articles, and weighing chains, frequently as low as 11 carats fine=38s. 11
               <num type="fraction" rend="horizontal">1/4</num>d., against sovereigns of 22 carats fine=77s. 10

               weighing 5 sovereigns being intrinsically worth only 50s. The object of the vendor is wholly to conceal the remaining 50s.</p>
            <p>Gold is capable of being alloyed to any extent, and in order to protect the public, 
               <orgName key="Watherston &amp; Brogden">WATHERSTON &amp; BROGDEN</orgName> will make the Mint. price of 77s. 10

            <p>The price for workmanship will be charged according to the intricacy or simplicity of the pattern. For example--</p>

            <note xml:id="n2">Dr. John Lindley, mentioned across multiple ads contained within
               Dickens’ Bleak House front matter, was a botanist from the University of England.
               During his time at the University of England, he was actually the first professor of
               botany to work at the University; spending his time working on articles and
               editorials on botany for other academics. Amidst this, as it appears through the
               Bleak House front matter he would also spend time writing articles on more common
               houseplants and widespread information that would cater to wider audiences; further
               fueling his renown and commonplace within Bleak House ads. <ref type="biblio"
