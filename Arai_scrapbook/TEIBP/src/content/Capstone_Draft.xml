                 Japanese farmers who formerly took their produce to the markets to sell it also
                 were absent. Even though they live outside the evacuation area, they are barred

             <head rendition=" #center-align">____________</head>
             <p>Seattle's central business district gave the appearance of a city without
                 Japanese today as the last of them from Zones No. 1 and 2, or population,
                 departed for <name ref="#camp_harmony">the assembly center in
                 Puyallup.</name></p>
             <p> And the <placeName ref="#pike_place">Pike Place Markets</placeName> for the
                 first time in their years of operation, did business without their myriad of
                 Japanese-operated stalls. </p>
             <p> It is estimated that only about half the Japanese of the city have been removed
                 but those who have gone were from areas in which many were engaged in business
                 and where they most often met public. </p>
             <p> Those Japanese remaining in the city are restricted to movement within the area
                 in which they live. Beginning at noon, they and all others of the Japanese race
                 were banned from going to the central business district, the waterfront or any
                 place in the area to the north of the city that lies west of Eastlake Avenue and
                 Roosevelt Way, any place west of Fifth Avenue in the central area, or any place
                 south of Jackson Street in the southern area, except for one small locality
                 between Jackson and Dearborn Streets. </p>
             <p>This ban prevents any Japanese in the farming community surrounding the city from
                 delivering produce to Seattle firms personally, as Produce Row and the markets
                 cannot be reached without passing through a restricted area.</p>
             <p> The market master of the municipal market said that not a single Japanese
                 merchant appeared this morning, although the ban did not go into effect until
                 noon. </p>
             <p> Operators of private markets said several Japanese renters of stalls came early
                 this morning with produce but brought Filipinos with them to tend the stalls and
                 left before noon. </p>
             <p>No date has been set for removal of the Japanese from there</p>

             <p>Evacuation of all Japanese from Kitsap County, western Pierce County and the

                 Defense Command and Fourth Army.</p>
             <p>One order, No. 67, takes in Tacoma, Fort Lewis, McChord Field, Steilacoom and
                 that portion of King County west of Highway 99 and south of Des Moines. The
                 1,100 Japanese living in this area are to be evacuated by noon Monday.</p>
             <p>OTHER AREAS</p>
             <p>The other order, No. 68, takes in the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton and all
                 the rest of Kitsap County, except Bainbridge Island which was evacuated earlier;
                 Vashon Island in King County and the island and Olympic Peninsula sections of
                 Pierce County. The 200 Japanese living in this area are to be evacuated by noon
                 Saturday.</p>
             <p>The destination of the Japanese affected by these orders was not announced, but
                 the fact that they were advised they would not be permitted to use private

             <p>It was considered probable that they would be sent to the assembly center at
                 Pinedale, Calif., to join evacuees from the rural districts of King and Pierce

             <p>Prospective evacuees in the area covered by Order No. 67 will register between 8

                 Ave., Tacoma.</p>
             <p>There will be two registration points, open during the same hours on the same

              <p>Registration of all Japanese remaining in Seattle started yesterday and will
                  continue today at the newest civil control station, 2203 E. Madison St.</p>
              <p>Like the registrations which preceded it, everything was varied out in an orderly
                  manner with a minimum of confusion. It is expected that 1,098 Japanese remain in
                  the last Seattle district to be evacuated, and all will be registered and get
                  their <name ref="#camp_harmony">Puyallup center</name> assignments by 5 o’clock

              <p rendition="#caps">Puyallup, too</p>
              <p>At the same time, registration was proceeding in Puyallup of some 1,000 Japanese
                  living in Eastern Pierce County. They are to be sent to an evacuation center at
                  Pinedale, Calif., where Japanese from rural King County south of Seattle are
                  also going.</p>
              <p>Among those who registered yesterday were a number of Japanese who are married to
                  men or women of other races.</p>
              <p>Orders are expected this week to evacuate all of the remaining Japanese in King
                  County. They still remain in rural areas north and east of Seattle, and a
                  smaller portion of Southern King County.</p>

                 24—Although some of them have been here scarcely a week, Seattle Japanese are
                 adjusting themselves rapidly to conditions at this assembly center, and the camp
                 is really living up to its name.</p>
             <p>Life is very different from anything to which they had been accustomed, but they
                 are making the best of things as they found them, and remarkably few complaints
                 are heard.</p>
             <p>Maybe the secret lies in the fact that they have so little idle time on their
                 hands. If they are not just before the travel of all Japanese was restricted. </p>
             <p>Her husband build a wardrobe, a linen closet, a vanity and bench and other
                 bedroom furniture out of scrap lumber and she supplied the feminine touch with
                 draperies that give the room a really homelike appearance.</p>
             <p>A completely democratic spirit prevails in the camp, because practically everyone
                 is on the same economic status.</p>
             <p>This is because there is so little difference in scales of pay. A common laborer
                 receives $8 a month,</p>

             <p>COMFORT OF HOME—Mrs. Robert Hosokawa, recent Willamette coed, laying out a new
                 apron in the cozy apartment which she and her husband have contrived to make out
                 of their bare barracks. Her husband constructed the furniture out of scrap
                 lumber and his drive of two months achieved the rest with a few draperies.</p>
             <p>__________________________________</p>

             <p>busy on work details or administrative duties, there is always something to do
                 around their temporary homes — because the army didn’t have time to indulge in
                 any of the niceties of interior decoration in constructing their barracks. </p>
             <p>And, as if that weren’t enough, many of them have put in tiny Victory Gardens.
                 For instance, Clarence Arai, for years a prominent Seattle attorney, has put in
                 radishes, beets, Chinese lettuce and onions — and his little plot is as
                 meticulously neat as if he were a professional gardener. </p>
             <p>They take pride in the amount of ingenuity they can show in making their
                 primitive quarters look more like the homes they left behind them.</p>
             <p>An outstanding example in this respect is furnished by the apartment where
                     <name>Robert Hosokawa</name>, formerly a furniture salesman in Seattle, is
                 spending his honeymoon. His brider, the former <name>Yoshi Yoshizawa</name>,
                 twenty, was a junior in Willamette University when the first evacuation orders
                 were issued. She hurried to Seattle to be married [...] a skilled laborer $12
                 and a professional man or woman $16. This pay, of course, is in addition to
                 their board and lodging and medical and dental attention.</p>
             <p>The dental clinic is one of the busiest centers in the camp, with as many as
                 eighteen or twenty patients in a single morning — which isn’t excessive in view
                 of the fact that the center has an estimated population of 7,500.</p>
             <p>Six former Seattle dentists are on duty there — <name>Dr. S. Higashida</name> and
                 his son, Robert; <name>Dr. H. Mitsumori</name>, <name>Dr. F. Kinemori</name>,
                     <name>Dr. G. Y. Nomura</name> and <name>Dr. S. Ishihashi</name>.</p>
             <p>A paper has been started, with <name>Dick Takeuchi</name>, former editor of the
                 Great Northern Daily News, in charge. Takeuchi, who was a journalism senior at
                 the University of Washington, has tentatively called the paper the Camp Harmony
                 News Letter, but he isn’t satisfied and has asked his readers to suggest other
                 names. </p>
             <p><name>Dyke Miyagawa</name>, another University of Washington senior, is his
                 managing editor, and Taka Oka, a sophomore, is assistant managing editor. </p>
             <p><name>Keith Oka</name>, formerly employed at the Craftsmen’s Press, is art
                 editor, and <name>Tad Kuniyuki</name>, formerly sports editor for the Japanese
                 American Courier, has a similar job there. </p>
             <p><name>James Y. Sakamoto</name>, former publisher of the Japanese American Courier
                 and now chief Japanese supervisor of the camp, has set up his headquarters
                 underneath the grandstand on the fairgrounds and keeps busy from morning to
                 night consulting with members of his staff. </p>
             <p><name>Bill Hosokawa</name>, University of Washington graduate and former editor
                 of a newspaper in Singapore, is his chief adjutant. The headquarters staff is
                 divided into five general sections, with <name>George Ishihara</name>, produce
                 shipper, in charge of personnel; <name>Jack Maki</name>, associate in the Far
                 Eastern department at the University of Washington, in charge of information;
                     <name>Dick Setsuda</name>, beer distributor, in charge of operations;
                     <name>Thomas Iseri</name>, Auburn produce shipper, in charge of supply, and
                     <name>Julius Fujihara</name>, in charge of police, fire, postal and other
                 services.</p>
             <p>Leaders of the four areas into which the center is divided are <name>William
                     Mimbu</name>, attorney; <name>Yakeo Nogaki</name> and <name>Teruji
                     Umino</name>, both bank clerks, and <name>Hiroyuki (“Lefty”)
                 Ichihara</name>, who had a fishing tackle store in Seattle.</p>
             <p>All of these executives, incidentally, are American-born Japanese. </p>
             <p>Life in the camp is by no means all work and no play. </p>
             <p>Churches have supplied a piano for each of the four areas and there is plenty of
                 community singing and choir practice.</p>
             <p>There are athletic facilities for all ages, and a number of soft ball and ping
                 pong tournaments are already in progress. </p>
             <p>There are recreational rooms in each area. </p>
             <p><name>Jack Maki</name>, the former University faculty member, summed up the
                 attitude of the evacuees when he said: </p>
             <p>“We aren’t being mistreated, but, on the other hand, we aren’t being pampered — I
                 think everybody’s doing a swell job."</p>

              <p>We were so sorry not to have you with us Friday night. We tried to make it an
                  especially nice affair since it was to be the last one before <name
                      ref="#jennings">Mr Jennings</name> retired. As toastmistress, I read your
                  letter and when the suggestion was made that greetings be sent to you, you
                  should have heard the applause, so you can see what a place you hold in our
                  minds and hearts.</p>
              
              <p>The dining room at the Ranier Club looked very beautiful with the tables
                  decorated with rhododendrons and iris and colorful <name
                      ref="#spl_banquet_program">programs</name>, serving also as place cards.
                  There were one hundred and forty-one present.</p>
              
              <p>Between courses we sang the songs printed in <name ref="#spl_banquet_program">the
                      program</name> and then we had a series of humorous book reviews supposedly
                  suggestions for the book case in the new house <name ref="#jennings">Mr
                      Jennings</name> is building across Lake Washington. After the last of these
                  the group burst into the song “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow.” Then we said we
                  had a real book for him and Miss Andrus presented him with the portfolio of
                  letters, one of which you wrote, - there were over a hundred altogether, and was
                  he pleased!</p>
              
              <p>He made a little speech of appreciation and then it was Mrs. Quigley’s turn to
                  add to the book-shelf. She presented him with a book containing a diploma saying
                  that he had completed thirty-five years of successful service “summa cum laude”,
                  and then she presented Mr Richards, the new librarian, with a schedule book such
                  as they give Freshmen at the University, listing the courses he’d have to take
                  such as Handling the Board, Pleasing the Staff, Balancing the Budget, etc. Mr
                  Richards then said briefly how pleased he and Mrs Richards were to be included
                  and how much he was looking forward to his work.</p>
              
              <p>Last of all we said we thought the best books to have on our shelves were the
                  master works that were standbys through thick and thin to guide and comfort us
                  and then Miss Eberlin presented <name ref="#jennings">Mr Jennings</name> with a
                  Columbia Master Works Album of Beethoven’s “Tempest” Sonata, first speaking of
                  records and how librarians have always”kept</p>

                  occurred to us he would need something to play it on it on and so there was a
                  companion volume to this. Covered with a cloth in the alcover back of the
                  speakers table was an R.C.A. Radio-Victrola which Miss Eberlin then uncovered.
                  <name ref="#jennings">Mr Jennings</name> was quite overcome. “I can’t say
                  anything” was all he could say, so we joined hands around the table and sang
                  Auld Lang Syne, and that was the end.</p>
              
              <p>We surely wished many times during the evening that you and Mrs Arai might be
                  with us and I know I am expressing the feeling of the whole group when I say
                  that you have our very best wishes and that we hope this trying period through
                  which you are passing may seem more bearable as time goes on. This morning’s

                  your new work. “You can’t keep a good man down”, you know.</p>

                    wish to express to you our regret that you are unable to serve longer with them
                    in the labor of sreving the citizens of Seattle in their library needs.</p>
                <p> We do wish, however, to let you know how much we have enjoyed your disinterested
                    advice - your willingness to serve faithfully and your just approach to all
                    problems that have come before the Board.</p>
                <p>Your viewpoint has always been wholesome, un- prejudiced and eminently fair and
                    we shall all miss your congenial companionship at our Board meetings, as well as
                    the presence of Mrs. Arai and yourself at the annual banquet of the <name

                <p>While we recognize that under present conditions many things arise that give much
                    distress, we know that your sound philosophy and unfailing good humour will ever
                    attend you.</p>
